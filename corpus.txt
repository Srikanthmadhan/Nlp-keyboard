london illustration to j comyns carr in acknowledgment of all i owe to his friendship and advice these illustrations are gratefully inscribed hugh thomson preface illustration walt whitman has somewhere a fine and just distinction between loving by allowance and loving with personal love this distinction applies to books as well as to men and women and in the case of the not very numerous authors who are the objects of the personal affection it brings a curious consequence with it there is much more difference as to their best work than in the case of those others who are loved by allowance by convention and because it is felt to be the right and proper thing to love them and in the sect fairly large and yet unusually choice of austenians or janites there would probably be found partisans of the claim to primacy of almost every one of the novels to some the delightful freshness and humour of northanger abbey its completeness finish and entrain obscure the undoubted critical facts that its scale is small and its scheme after all that of burlesque or parody a kind in which the first rank is reached with difficulty persuasion relatively faint in tone and not enthralling in interest has devotees who exalt above all the others its exquisite delicacy and keeping the catastrophe of mansfield park is admittedly theatrical the hero and heroine are insipid and the author has almost wickedly destroyed all romantic interest by expressly admitting that edmund only took fanny because mary shocked him and that fanny might very likely have taken crawford if he had been a little more assiduous yet the matchless rehearsal scenes and the characters of mrs norris and others have secured i believe a considerable party for it sense and sensibility has perhaps the fewest out and out admirers but it does not want them i suppose however that the majority of at least competent votes would all things considered be divided between emma and the present book and perhaps the vulgar verdict if indeed a fondness for miss austen be not of itself a patent of exemption from any possible charge of vulgarity would go for emma it is the larger the more varied the more popular the author had by the time of its composition seen rather more of the world and had improved her general though not her most peculiar and characteristic dialogue such figures as miss bates as the eltons cannot but unite the suffrages of everybody on the other hand i for my part declare for pride and prejudice unhesitatingly it seems to me the most perfect the most characteristic the most eminently quintessential of its author s works and for this contention in such narrow space as is permitted to me i propose here to show cause in the first place the book it may be barely necessary to remind the reader was in its first shape written very early somewhere about when miss austen was barely twenty one though it was revised and finished at chawton some fifteen years later and was not published till only four years before her death i do not know whether in this combination of the fresh and vigorous projection of youth and the critical revision of middle life there may be traced the distinct superiority in point of construction which as it seems to me it possesses over all the others the plot though not elaborate is almost regular enough for fielding hardly a character hardly an incident could be retrenched without loss to the story the elopement of lydia and wickham is not like that of crawford and mrs rushworth a coup de th tre it connects itself in the strictest way with the course of the story earlier and brings about the denouement with complete propriety all the minor passages the loves of jane and bingley the advent of mr collins the visit to hunsford the derbyshire tour fit in after the same unostentatious but masterly fashion there is no attempt at the hide and seek in and out business which in the transactions between frank churchill and jane fairfax contributes no doubt a good deal to the intrigue of emma but contributes it in a fashion which i do not think the best feature of that otherwise admirable book although miss austen always liked something of the misunderstanding kind which afforded her opportunities for the display of the peculiar and incomparable talent to be noticed presently she has been satisfied here with the perfectly natural occasions provided by the false account of darcy s conduct given by wickham and by the awkwardness arising with equal naturalness from the gradual transformation of elizabeth s own feelings from positive aversion to actual love i do not know whether the all grasping hand of the playwright has ever been laid upon pride and prejudice and i dare say that if it were the situations would prove not startling or garish enough for the footlights the character scheme too subtle and delicate for pit and gallery but if the attempt were made it would certainly not be hampered by any of those loosenesses of construction which sometimes disguised by the conveniences of which the novelist can avail himself appear at once on the stage i think however though the thought will doubtless seem heretical to more than one school of critics that construction is not the highest merit the choicest gift of the novelist it sets off his other gifts and graces most advantageously to the critical eye and the want of it will sometimes mar those graces appreciably though not quite consciously to eyes by no means ultra critical but a very badly built novel which excelled in pathetic or humorous character or which displayed consummate command of dialogue perhaps the rarest of all faculties would be an infinitely better thing than a faultless plot acted and told by puppets with pebbles in their mouths and despite the ability which miss austen has shown in working out the story i for one should put pride and prejudice far lower if it did not contain what seem to me the very masterpieces of miss austen s humour and of her faculty of character creation masterpieces who may indeed admit john thorpe the eltons mrs norris and one or two others to their company but who in one instance certainly and perhaps in others are still superior to them the characteristics of miss austen s humour are so subtle and delicate that they are perhaps at all times easier to apprehend than to express and at any particular time likely to be differently apprehended by different persons to me this humour seems to possess a greater affinity on the whole to that of addison than to any other of the numerous species of this great british genus the differences of scheme of time of subject of literary convention are of course obvious enough the difference of sex does not perhaps count for much for there was a distinctly feminine element in mr spectator and in jane austen s genius there was though nothing mannish much that was masculine but the likeness of quality consists in a great number of common subdivisions of quality demureness extreme minuteness of touch avoidance of loud tones and glaring effects also there is in both a certain not inhuman or unamiable cruelty it is the custom with those who judge grossly to contrast the good nature of addison with the savagery of swift the mildness of miss austen with the boisterousness of fielding and smollett even with the ferocious practical jokes that her immediate predecessor miss burney allowed without very much protest yet both in mr addison and in miss austen there is though a restrained and well mannered an insatiable and ruthless delight in roasting and cutting up a fool a man in the early eighteenth century of course could push this taste further than a lady in the early nineteenth and no doubt miss austen s principles as well as her heart would have shrunk from such things as the letter from the unfortunate husband in the spectator who describes with all the gusto and all the innocence in the world how his wife and his friend induce him to play at blind man s buff but another spectator letter that of the damsel of fourteen who wishes to marry mr shapely and assures her selected mentor that he admires your spectators mightily might have been written by a rather more ladylike and intelligent lydia bennet in the days of lydia s great grandmother while on the other hand some i think unreasonably have found cynicism in touches of miss austen s own such as her satire of mrs musgrove s self deceiving regrets over her son but this word cynical is one of the most misused in the english language especially when by a glaring and gratuitous falsification of its original sense it is applied not to rough and snarling invective but to gentle and oblique satire if cynicism means the perception of the other side the sense of the accepted hells beneath the consciousness that motives are nearly always mixed and that to seem is not identical with to be if this be cynicism then every man and woman who is not a fool who does not care to live in a fool s paradise who has knowledge of nature and the world and life is a cynic and in that sense miss austen certainly was one she may even have been one in the further sense that like her own mr bennet she took an epicurean delight in dissecting in displaying in setting at work her fools and her mean persons i think she did take this delight and i do not think at all the worse of her for it as a woman while she was immensely the better for it as an artist in respect of her art generally mr goldwin smith has truly observed that metaphor has been exhausted in depicting the perfection of it combined with the narrowness of her field and he has justly added that we need not go beyond her own comparison to the art of a miniature painter to make this latter observation quite exact we must not use the term miniature in its restricted sense and must think rather of memling at one end of the history of painting and meissonier at the other than of cosway or any of his kind and i am not so certain that i should myself use the word narrow in connection with her if her world is a microcosm the cosmic quality of it is at least as eminent as the littleness she does not touch what she did not feel herself called to paint i am not so sure that she could not have painted what she did not feel herself called to touch it is at least remarkable that in two very short periods of writing one of about three years and another of not much more than five she executed six capital works and has not left a single failure it is possible that the romantic paste in her composition was defective we must always remember that hardly anybody born in her decade that of the eighteenth century seventies independently exhibited the full romantic quality even scott required hill and mountain and ballad even coleridge metaphysics and german to enable them to chip the classical shell miss austen was an english girl brought up in a country retirement at the time when ladies went back into the house if there was a white frost which might pierce their kid shoes when a sudden cold was the subject of the gravest fears when their studies their ways their conduct were subject to all those fantastic limits and restrictions against which mary wollstonecraft protested with better general sense than particular taste or judgment miss austen too drew back when the white frost touched her shoes but i think she would have made a pretty good journey even in a black one for if her knowledge was not very extended she knew two things which only genius knows the one was humanity and the other was art on the first head she could not make a mistake her men though limited are true and her women are in the old sense absolute as to art if she has never tried idealism her realism is real to a degree which makes the false realism of our own day look merely dead alive take almost any frenchman except the late m de maupassant and watch him laboriously piling up strokes in the hope of giving a complete impression you get none you are lucky if discarding two thirds of what he gives you can shape a real impression out of the rest but with miss austen the myriad trivial unforced strokes build up the picture like magic nothing is false nothing is superfluous when to take the present book only mr collins changed his mind from jane to elizabeth while mrs bennet was stirring the fire and we know how mrs bennet would have stirred the fire when mr darcy brought his coffee cup back himself the touch in each case is like that of swift taller by the breadth of my nail which impressed the half reluctant thackeray with just and outspoken admiration indeed fantastic as it may seem i should put miss austen as near to swift in some ways as i have put her to addison in others this swiftian quality appears in the present novel as it appears nowhere else in the character of the immortal the ineffable mr collins mr collins is really great far greater than anything addison ever did almost great enough for fielding or for swift himself it has been said that no one ever was like him but in the first place he was like him he is there alive imperishable more real than hundreds of prime ministers and archbishops of metals semi metals and distinguished philosophers in the second place it is rash i think to conclude that an actual mr collins was impossible or non existent at the end of the eighteenth century it is very interesting that we possess in this same gallery what may be called a spoiled first draught or an unsuccessful study of him in john dashwood the formality the under breeding the meanness are there but the portrait is only half alive and is felt to be even a little unnatural mr collins is perfectly natural and perfectly alive in fact for all the miniature there is something gigantic in the way in which a certain side and more than one of humanity and especially eighteenth century humanity its philistinism its well meaning but hide bound morality its formal pettiness its grovelling respect for rank its materialism its selfishness receives exhibition i will not admit that one speech or one action of this inestimable man is incapable of being reconciled with reality and i should not wonder if many of these words and actions are historically true but the greatness of mr collins could not have been so satisfactorily exhibited if his creatress had not adjusted so artfully to him the figures of mr bennet and of lady catherine de bourgh the latter like mr collins himself has been charged with exaggeration there is perhaps a very faint shade of colour for the charge but it seems to me very faint indeed even now i do not think that it would be impossible to find persons especially female persons not necessarily of noble birth as overbearing as self centred as neglectful of good manners as lady catherine a hundred years ago an earl s daughter the lady powerful if not exactly bountiful of an out of the way country parish rich long out of marital authority and so forth had opportunities of developing these agreeable characteristics which seldom present themselves now as for mr bennet miss austen and mr darcy and even miss elizabeth herself were i am inclined to think rather hard on him for the impropriety of his conduct his wife was evidently and must always have been a quite irreclaimable fool and unless he had shot her or himself there was no way out of it for a man of sense and spirit but the ironic from no other point of view is he open to any reproach except for an excusable and not unnatural helplessness at the crisis of the elopement and his utterances are the most acutely delightful in the consciously humorous kind in the kind that we laugh with not at that even miss austen has put into the mouth of any of her characters it is difficult to know whether he is most agreeable when talking to his wife or when putting mr collins through his paces but the general sense of the world has probably been right in preferring to the first rank his consolation to the former when she maunders over the entail my dear do not give way to such gloomy thoughts let us hope for better things let us flatter ourselves that i may be the survivor and his inquiry to his colossal cousin as to the compliments which mr collins has just related as made by himself to lady catherine may i ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment or are the result of previous study these are the things which give miss austen s readers the pleasant shocks the delightful thrills which are felt by the readers of swift of fielding and we may here add of thackeray as they are felt by the readers of no other english author of fiction outside of these four the goodness of the minor characters in pride and prejudice has been already alluded to and it makes a detailed dwelling on their beauties difficult in any space and impossible in this mrs bennet we have glanced at and it is not easy to say whether she is more exquisitely amusing or more horribly true much the same may be said of kitty and lydia but it is not every author even of genius who would have differentiated with such unerring skill the effects of folly and vulgarity of intellect and disposition working upon the common weaknesses of woman at such different ages with mary miss austen has taken rather less pains though she has been even more unkind to her not merely in the text but as we learn from those interesting traditional appendices which mr austen leigh has given us in dooming her privately to marry one of mr philips s clerks the habits of first copying and then retailing moral sentiments of playing and singing too long in public are no doubt grievous and criminal but perhaps poor mary was rather the scapegoat of the sins of blue stockings in that fordyce belectured generation it is at any rate difficult not to extend to her a share of the respect and affection affection and respect of a peculiar kind doubtless with which one regards mr collins when she draws the moral of lydia s fall i sometimes wish that the exigencies of the story had permitted miss austen to unite these personages and thus at once achieve a notable mating and soothe poor mrs bennet s anguish over the entail the bingleys and the gardiners and the lucases miss darcy and miss de bourgh jane wickham and the rest must pass without special comment further than the remark that charlotte lucas her egregious papa though delightful is just a little on the thither side of the line between comedy and farce is a wonderfully clever study in drab of one kind and that wickham though something of miss austen s hesitation of touch in dealing with young men appears is a not much less notable sketch in drab of another only genius could have made charlotte what she is yet not disagreeable wickham what he is without investing him either with a cheap don juanish attractiveness or a disgusting rascality but the hero and the heroine are not tints to be dismissed darcy has always seemed to me by far the best and most interesting of miss austen s heroes the only possible competitor being henry tilney whose part is so slight and simple that it hardly enters into comparison it has sometimes i believe been urged that his pride is unnatural at first in its expression and later in its yielding while his falling in love at all is not extremely probable here again i cannot go with the objectors darcy s own account of the way in which his pride had been pampered is perfectly rational and sufficient and nothing could be psychologically speaking a causa verior for its sudden restoration to healthy conditions than the shock of elizabeth s scornful refusal acting on a nature ex hypothesi generous nothing in even our author is finer and more delicately touched than the change of his demeanour at the sudden meeting in the grounds of pemberley had he been a bad prig or a bad coxcomb he might have been still smarting under his rejection or suspicious that the girl had come husband hunting his being neither is exactly consistent with the probable feelings of a man spoilt in the common sense but not really injured in disposition and thoroughly in love as for his being in love elizabeth has given as just an exposition of the causes of that phenomenon as darcy has of the conditions of his unregenerate state only she has of course not counted in what was due to her own personal charm the secret of that charm many men and not a few women from miss austen herself downwards have felt and like most charms it is a thing rather to be felt than to be explained elizabeth of course belongs to the allegro or allegra division of the army of venus miss austen was always provokingly chary of description in regard to her beauties and except the fine eyes and a hint or two that she had at any rate sometimes a bright complexion and was not very tall we hear nothing about her looks but her chief difference from other heroines of the lively type seems to lie first in her being distinctly clever almost strong minded in the better sense of that objectionable word and secondly in her being entirely destitute of ill nature for all her propensity to tease and the sharpness of her tongue elizabeth can give at least as good as she gets when she is attacked but she never scratches and she never attacks first some of the merest obsoletenesses of phrase and manner give one or two of her early speeches a slight pertness but that is nothing and when she comes to serious business as in the great proposal scene with darcy which is as it should be the climax of the interest of the book and in the final ladies battle with lady catherine she is unexceptionable then too she is a perfectly natural girl she does not disguise from herself or anybody that she resents darcy s first ill mannered personality with as personal a feeling by the way the reproach that the ill manners of this speech are overdone is certainly unjust for things of the same kind expressed no doubt less stiltedly but more coarsely might have been heard in more than one ball room during this very year from persons who ought to have been no worse bred than darcy and she lets the injury done to jane and the contempt shown to the rest of her family aggravate this resentment in the healthiest way in the world still all this does not explain her charm which taking beauty as a common form of all heroines may perhaps consist in the addition to her playfulness her wit her affectionate and natural disposition of a certain fearlessness very uncommon in heroines of her type and age nearly all of them would have been in speechless awe of the magnificent darcy nearly all of them would have palpitated and fluttered at the idea of proposals even naughty ones from the fascinating wickham elizabeth with nothing offensive nothing viraginous nothing of the new woman about her has by nature what the best modern not new women have by education and experience a perfect freedom from the idea that all men may bully her if they choose and that most will away with her if they can though not in the least impudent and mannish grown she has no mere sensibility no nasty niceness about her the form of passion common and likely to seem natural in miss austen s day was so invariably connected with the display of one or the other or both of these qualities that she has not made elizabeth outwardly passionate but i at least have not the slightest doubt that she would have married darcy just as willingly without pemberley as with it and anybody who can read between lines will not find the lovers conversations in the final chapters so frigid as they might have looked to the della cruscans of their own day and perhaps do look to the della cruscans of this and after all what is the good of seeking for the reason of charm it is there there were better sense in the sad mechanic exercise of determining the reason of its absence where it is not in the novels of the last hundred years there are vast numbers of young ladies with whom it might be a pleasure to fall in love there are at least five with whom as it seems to me no man of taste and spirit can help doing so their names are in chronological order elizabeth bennet diana vernon argemone lavington beatrix esmond and barbara grant i should have been most in love with beatrix and argemone i should i think for mere occasional companionship have preferred diana and barbara but to live with and to marry i

i it is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife however little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters my dear mr bennet said his lady to him one day have you heard that netherfield park is let at last mr bennet replied that he had not but it is returned she for mrs long has just been here and she told me all about it mr bennet made no answer do not you want to know who has taken it cried his wife impatiently you want to tell me and i have no objection to hearing it illustration he came down to see the place copyright by george allen this was invitation enough why my dear you must know mrs long says that netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of england that he came down on monday in a chaise and four to see the place and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with mr morris immediately that he is to take possession before michaelmas and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week what is his name bingley is he married or single oh single my dear to be sure a single man of large fortune four or five thousand a year what a fine thing for our girls how so how can it affect them my dear mr bennet replied his wife how can you be so tiresome you must know that i am thinking of his marrying one of them is that his design in settling here design nonsense how can you talk so but it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes i see no occasion for that you and the girls may go or you may send them by themselves which perhaps will be still better for as you are as handsome as any of them mr bingley might like you the best of the party my dear you flatter me i certainly have had my share of beauty but i do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now when a woman has five grown up daughters she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty in such cases a woman has not often much beauty to think of but my dear you must indeed go and see mr bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood it is more than i engage for i assure you but consider your daughters only think what an establishment it would be for one of them sir william and lady lucas are determined to go merely on that account for in general you know they visit no new comers indeed you must go for it will be impossible for us to visit him if you do not you are over scrupulous surely i dare say mr bingley will be very glad to see you and i will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls though i must throw in a good word for my little lizzy i desire you will do no such thing lizzy is not a bit better than the others and i am sure she is not half so handsome as jane nor half so good humoured as lydia but you are always giving her the preference they have none of them much to recommend them replied he they are all silly and ignorant like other girls but lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters mr bennet how can you abuse your own children in such a way you take delight in vexing me you have no compassion on my poor nerves you mistake me my dear i have a high respect for your nerves they are my old friends i have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least ah you do not know what i suffer but i hope you will get over it and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood it will be no use to us if twenty such should come since you will not visit them depend upon it my dear that when there are twenty i will visit them all mr bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts sarcastic humour reserve and caprice that the experience of three and twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character her mind was less difficult to develope she was a woman of mean understanding little information and uncertain temper when she was discontented she fancied herself nervous the business of her life was to get her daughters married its solace was visiting and news illustration m r m rs bennet copyright by george allen illustration i hope mr bingley will like it copyright by george allen chapter ii illustration mr bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on mr bingley he had always intended to visit him though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go and till the evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it it was then disclosed in the following manner observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat he suddenly addressed her with i hope mr bingley will like it lizzy we are not in a way to know what mr bingley likes said her mother resentfully since we are not to visit but you forget mamma said elizabeth that we shall meet him at the assemblies and that mrs long has promised to introduce him i do not believe mrs long will do any such thing she has two nieces of her own she is a selfish hypocritical woman and i have no opinion of her no more have i said mr bennet and i am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you mrs bennet deigned not to make any reply but unable to contain herself began scolding one of her daughters don t keep coughing so kitty for heaven s sake have a little compassion on my nerves you tear them to pieces kitty has no discretion in her coughs said her father she times them ill i do not cough for my own amusement replied kitty fretfully when is your next ball to be lizzy to morrow fortnight ay so it is cried her mother and mrs long does not come back till the day before so it will be impossible for her to introduce him for she will not know him herself then my dear you may have the advantage of your friend and introduce mr bingley to her impossible mr bennet impossible when i am not acquainted with him myself how can you be so teasing i honour your circumspection a fortnight s acquaintance is certainly very little one cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight but if we do not venture somebody else will and after all mrs long and her nieces must stand their chance and therefore as she will think it an act of kindness if you decline the office i will take it on myself the girls stared at their father mrs bennet said only nonsense nonsense what can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation cried he do you consider the forms of introduction and the stress that is laid on them as nonsense i cannot quite agree with you there what say you mary for you are a young lady of deep reflection i know and read great books and make extracts mary wished to say something very sensible but knew not how while mary is adjusting her ideas he continued let us return to mr bingley i am sick of mr bingley cried his wife i am sorry to hear that but why did you not tell me so before if i had known as much this morning i certainly would not have called on him it is very unlucky but as i have actually paid the visit we cannot escape the acquaintance now the astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished that of mrs bennet perhaps surpassing the rest though when the first tumult of joy was over she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while how good it was in you my dear mr bennet but i knew i should persuade you at last i was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance well how pleased i am and it is such a good joke too that you should have gone this morning and never said a word about it till now now kitty you may cough as much as you choose said mr bennet and as he spoke he left the room fatigued with the raptures of his wife what an excellent father you have girls said she when the door was shut i do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness or me either for that matter at our time of life it is not so pleasant i can tell you to be making new acquaintances every day but for your sakes we would do anything lydia my love though you are the youngest i dare say mr bingley will dance with you at the next ball oh said lydia stoutly i am not afraid for though i am the youngest i m the tallest the rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return mr bennet s visit and determining when they should ask him to dinner illustration i m the tallest illustration he rode a black horse chapter iii illustration not all that mrs bennet however with the assistance of her five daughters could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of mr bingley they attacked him in various ways with barefaced questions ingenious suppositions and distant surmises but he eluded the skill of them all and they were at last obliged to accept the second hand intelligence of their neighbour lady lucas her report was highly favourable sir william had been delighted with him he was quite young wonderfully handsome extremely agreeable and to crown the whole he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party nothing could be more delightful to be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love and very lively hopes of mr bingley s heart were entertained if i can but see one of my daughters happily settled at netherfield said mrs bennet to her husband and all the others equally well married i shall have nothing to wish for in a few days mr bingley returned mr bennet s visit and sat about ten minutes with him in his library he had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies of whose beauty he had heard much but he saw only the father the ladies were somewhat more fortunate for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse an invitation to dinner was soon afterwards despatched and already had mrs bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping when an answer arrived which deferred it all mr bingley was obliged to be in town the following day and consequently unable to accept the honour of their invitation etc mrs bennet was quite disconcerted she could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in hertfordshire and she began to fear that he might always be flying about from one place to another and never settled at netherfield as he ought to be lady lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his illustration when the party entered copyright by george allen being gone to london only to get a large party for the ball and a report soon followed that mr bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly the girls grieved over such a number of ladies but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing that instead of twelve he had brought only six with him from london his five sisters and a cousin and when the party entered the assembly room it consisted of only five altogether mr bingley his two sisters the husband of the eldest and another young man mr bingley was good looking and gentlemanlike he had a pleasant countenance and easy unaffected manners his sisters were fine women with an air of decided fashion his brother in law mr hurst merely looked the gentleman but his friend mr darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine tall person handsome features noble mien and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance of his having ten thousand a year the gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man the ladies declared he was much handsomer than mr bingley and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity for he was discovered to be proud to be above his company and above being pleased and not all his large estate in derbyshire could save him from having a most forbidding disagreeable countenance and being unworthy to be compared with his friend mr bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room he was lively and unreserved danced every dance was angry that the ball closed so early and talked of giving one himself at netherfield such amiable qualities must speak for themselves what a contrast between him and his friend mr darcy danced only once with mrs hurst and once with miss bingley declined being introduced to any other lady and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room speaking occasionally to one of his own party his character was decided he was the proudest most disagreeable man in the world and everybody hoped that he would never come there again amongst the most violent against him was mrs bennet whose dislike of his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his having slighted one of her daughters elizabeth bennet had been obliged by the scarcity of gentlemen to sit down for two dances and during part of that time mr darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and mr bingley who came from the dance for a few minutes to press his friend to join it come darcy said he i must have you dance i hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner you had much better dance i certainly shall not you know how i detest it unless i am particularly acquainted with my partner at such an assembly as this it would be insupportable your sisters are engaged and there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with i would not be so fastidious as you are cried bingley for a kingdom upon my honour i never met with so many pleasant girls in my life as i have this evening and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty you are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room said mr darcy looking at the eldest miss bennet oh she is the most beautiful creature i ever beheld but there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you who is very pretty and i dare say very agreeable do let me ask my partner to introduce you illustration she is tolerable copyright by george allen which do you mean and turning round he looked for a moment at elizabeth till catching her eye he withdrew his own and coldly said she is tolerable but not handsome enough to tempt me and i am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men you had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles for you are wasting your time with me mr bingley followed his advice mr darcy walked off and elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him she told the story however with great spirit among her friends for she had a lively playful disposition which delighted in anything ridiculous the evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family mrs bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the netherfield party mr bingley had danced with her twice and she had been distinguished by his sisters jane was as much gratified by this as her mother could be though in a quieter way elizabeth felt jane s pleasure mary had heard herself mentioned to miss bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood and catherine and lydia had been fortunate enough to be never without partners which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball they returned therefore in good spirits to longbourn the village where they lived and of which they were the principal inhabitants they found mr bennet still up with a book he was regardless of time and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations he had rather hoped that all his wife s views on the stranger would be disappointed but he soon found that he had a very different story to hear oh my dear mr bennet as she entered the room we have had a most delightful evening a most excellent ball i wish you had been there jane was so admired nothing could be like it everybody said how well she looked and mr bingley thought her quite beautiful and danced with her twice only think of that my dear he actually danced with her twice and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time first of all he asked miss lucas i was so vexed to see him stand up with her but however he did not admire her at all indeed nobody can you know and he seemed quite struck with jane as she was going down the dance so he inquired who she was and got introduced and asked her for the two next then the two third he danced with miss king and the two fourth with maria lucas and the two fifth with jane again and the two sixth with lizzy and the boulanger if he had had any compassion for me cried her husband impatiently he would not have danced half so much for god s sake say no more of his partners o that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance oh my dear continued mrs bennet i am quite delighted with him he is so excessively handsome and his sisters are charming women i never in my life saw anything more elegant than their dresses i dare say the lace upon mrs hurst s gown here she was interrupted again mr bennet protested against any description of finery she was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject and related with much bitterness of spirit and some exaggeration the shocking rudeness of mr darcy but i can assure you she added that lizzy does not lose much by not suiting his fancy for he is a most disagreeable horrid man not at all worth pleasing so high and so conceited that there was no enduring him he walked here and he walked there fancying himself so very great not handsome enough to dance with i wish you had been there my dear to have given him one of your set downs i quite detest the man illustration chapter iv illustration when jane and elizabeth were alone the former who had been cautious in her praise of mr bingley before expressed to her sister how very much she admired him he is just what a young man ought to be said she sensible good humoured lively and i never saw such happy manners so much ease with such perfect good breeding he is also handsome replied elizabeth which a young man ought likewise to be if he possibly can his character is thereby complete i was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time i did not expect such a compliment did not you i did for you but that is one great difference between us compliments always take you by surprise and me never what could be more natural than his asking you again he could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room no thanks to his gallantry for that well he certainly is very agreeable and i give you leave to like him you have liked many a stupider person dear lizzy oh you are a great deal too apt you know to like people in general you never see a fault in anybody all the world are good and agreeable in your eyes i never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life i would wish not to be hasty in censuring anyone but i always speak what i think i know you do and it is that which makes the wonder with your good sense to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others affectation of candour is common enough one meets with it everywhere but to be candid without ostentation or design to take the good of everybody s character and make it still better and say nothing of the bad belongs to you alone and so you like this man s sisters too do you their manners are not equal to his certainly not at first but they are very pleasing women when you converse with them miss bingley is to live with her brother and keep his house and i am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her elizabeth listened in silence but was not convinced their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister and with a judgment too unassailed by any attention to herself she was very little disposed to approve them they were in fact very fine ladies not deficient in good humour when they were pleased nor in the power of being agreeable where they chose it but proud and conceited they were rather handsome had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds were in the habit of spending more than they ought and of associating with people of rank and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves and meanly of others they were of a respectable family in the north of england a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brother s fortune and their own had been acquired by trade mr bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred thousand pounds from his father who had intended to purchase an estate but did not live to do it mr bingley intended it likewise and sometimes made choice of his county but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at netherfield and leave the next generation to purchase his sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own but though he was now established only as a tenant miss bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table nor was mrs hurst who had married a man of more fashion than fortune less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her mr bingley had not been of age two years when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at netherfield house he did look at it and into it for half an hour was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms satisfied with what the owner said in its praise and took it immediately between him and darcy there was a very steady friendship in spite of a great opposition of character bingley was endeared to darcy by the easiness openness and ductility of his temper though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied on the strength of darcy s regard bingley had the firmest reliance and of his judgment the highest opinion in understanding darcy was the superior bingley was by no means deficient but darcy was clever he was at the same time haughty reserved and fastidious and his manners though well bred were not inviting in that respect his friend had greatly the advantage bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared darcy was continually giving offence the manner in which they spoke of the meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life everybody had been most kind and attentive to him there had been no formality no stiffness he had soon felt acquainted with all the room and as to miss bennet he could not conceive an angel more beautiful darcy on the contrary had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest and from none received either attention or pleasure miss bennet he acknowledged to be pretty but she smiled too much mrs hurst and her sister allowed it to be so but still they admired her and liked her and pronounced her to be a sweet girl and one whom they should not object to know more of miss bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl and their brother felt authorized by such commendation to think of her as he chose illustration copyright by george allen chapter v illustration within a short walk of longbourn lived a family with whom the bennets were particularly intimate sir william lucas had been formerly in trade in meryton where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty the distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly it had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town and quitting them both he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from meryton denominated from that period lucas lodge where he could think with pleasure of his own importance and unshackled by business occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world for though elated by his rank it did not render him supercilious on the contrary he was all attention to everybody by nature inoffensive friendly and obliging his presentation at st james s had made him courteous lady lucas was a very good kind of woman not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to mrs bennet they had several children the eldest of them a sensible intelligent young woman about twenty seven was elizabeth s intimate friend that the miss lucases and the miss bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary and the morning after the assembly brought the former to longbourn to hear and to communicate you began the evening well charlotte said mrs bennet with civil self command to miss lucas you were mr bingley s first choice yes but he seemed to like his second better oh you mean jane i suppose because he danced with her twice to be sure that did seem as if he admired her indeed i rather believe he did i heard something about it but i hardly know what something about mr robinson perhaps you mean what i overheard between him and mr robinson did not i mention it to you mr robinson s asking him how he liked our meryton assemblies and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room and which he thought the prettiest and his answering immediately to the last question oh the eldest miss bennet beyond a doubt there cannot be two opinions on that point upon my word well that was very decided indeed that does seem as if but however it may all come to nothing you know my overhearings were more to the purpose than yours eliza said charlotte mr darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend is he poor eliza to be only just tolerable i beg you will not put it into lizzy s head to be vexed by his ill treatment for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him mrs long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips illustration without once opening his lips copyright by george allen are you quite sure ma am is not there a little mistake said jane i certainly saw mr darcy speaking to her ay because she asked him at last how he liked netherfield and he could not help answering her but she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to miss bingley told me said jane that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance with them he is remarkably agreeable i do not believe a word of it my dear if he had been so very agreeable he would have talked to mrs long but i can guess how it was everybody says that he is eat up with pride and i dare say he had heard somehow that mrs long does not keep a carriage and had to come to the ball in a hack chaise i do not mind his not talking to mrs long said miss lucas but i wish he had danced with eliza another time lizzy said her mother i would not dance with him if i were you i believe ma am i may safely promise you never to dance with him his pride said miss lucas does not offend me so much as pride often does because there is an excuse for it one cannot wonder that so very fine a young man with family fortune everything in his favour should think highly of himself if i may so express it he has a right to be proud that is very true replied elizabeth and i could easily forgive his pride if he had not mortified mine pride observed mary who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections is a very common failing i believe by all that i have ever read i am convinced that it is very common indeed that human nature is particularly prone to it and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self complacency on the score of some quality or other real or imaginary vanity and pride are different things though the words are often used synonymously a person may be proud without being vain pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves vanity to what we would have others think of us if i were as rich as mr darcy cried a young lucas who came with his sisters i should not care how proud i was i would keep a pack of foxhounds and drink a bottle of wine every day then you would drink a great deal more than you ought said mrs bennet and if i were to see you at it i should take away your bottle directly the boy protested that she should not she continued to declare that she would and the argument ended only with the visit illustration illustration chapter vi illustration the ladies of longbourn soon waited on those of netherfield the visit was returned in due form miss bennet s pleasing manners grew on the good will of mrs hurst and miss bingley and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to a wish of being better acquainted with them was expressed towards the two eldest by jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of everybody hardly excepting even her sister and could not like them though their kindness to jane such as it was had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother s admiration it was generally evident whenever they met that he did admire her and to her it was equally evident that jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first and was in a way to be very much in love but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general since jane united with great strength of feeling a composure of temper and an uniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent she mentioned this to her friend miss lucas it may perhaps be pleasant replied charlotte to be able to impose on the public in such a case but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded if a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it she may lose the opportunity of fixing him and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment that it is not safe to leave any to itself we can all begin freely a slight preference is natural enough but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement in nine cases out of ten a woman had better show more affection than she feels bingley likes your sister undoubtedly but he may never do more than like her if she does not help him on but she does help him on as much as her nature will allow if i can perceive her regard for him he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too remember eliza that he does not know jane s disposition as you do but if a woman is partial to a man and does not endeavor to conceal it he must find it out perhaps he must if he sees enough of her but though bingley and jane meet tolerably often it is never for many hours together and as they always see each other in large mixed parties it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention when she is secure of him there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chooses your plan is a good one replied elizabeth where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married and if i were determined to get a rich husband or any husband i dare say i should adopt it but these are not jane s feelings she is not acting by design as yet she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its reasonableness she has known him only a fortnight she danced four dances with him at meryton she saw him one morning at his own house and has since dined in company with him four times this is not quite enough to make her understand his character not as you represent it had she merely dined with him she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together and four evenings may do a great deal yes these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like vingt un better than commerce but with respect to any other leading characteristic i do not imagine that much has been unfolded well said charlotte i wish jane success with all my heart and if she were married to him to morrow i should think she had as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance if the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other or ever so similar beforehand it does not advance their felicity in the least they always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life you make me laugh charlotte but it is not sound you know it is not sound and that you would never act in this way yourself occupied in observing mr bingley s attention to her sister elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend mr darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty he had looked at her without admiration at the ball and when they next met he looked at her only to criticise but no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes to this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world he was caught by their easy playfulness of this she was perfectly unaware to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable nowhere and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with he began to wish to know more of her and as a step towards conversing with her himself attended to her conversation with others his doing so drew her notice it was at sir william lucas s where a large party were assembled what does mr darcy mean said she to charlotte by listening to my conversation with colonel forster that is a question which mr darcy only can answer but if he does it any more i shall certainly let him know that i see what he is about he has a very satirical eye and if i do not begin by being impertinent myself i shall soon grow afraid of him illustration the entreaties of several copyright by george allen on his approaching them soon afterwards though without seeming to have any intention of speaking miss lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him which immediately provoking elizabeth to do it she turned to him and said did not you think mr darcy that i expressed myself uncommonly well just now when i was teasing colonel forster to give us a ball at meryton with great energy but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic you are severe on us it will be her turn soon to be teased said miss lucas i am going to open the instrument eliza and you know what follows you are a very strange creature by way of a friend always wanting me to play and sing before anybody and everybody if my vanity had taken a musical turn you would have been invaluable but as it is i would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers on miss lucas s persevering however she added very well if it must be so it must and gravely glancing at mr darcy there is a very fine old saying which everybody here is of course familiar with keep your breath to cool your porridge and i shall keep mine to swell my song her performance was pleasing though by no means capital after a song or two and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister mary who having in consequence of being the only plain one in the family worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments was always impatient for display mary had neither genius nor taste and though vanity had given her application it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached elizabeth easy and unaffected had been listened to with much more pleasure though not playing half so well and mary at the end of a long concerto was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by scotch and irish airs at the request of her younger sisters who with some of the lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room mr darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening to the exclusion of all conversation and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that sir william lucas was his neighbour till sir william thus began what a charming amusement for young people this is mr darcy there is nothing like dancing after all i consider it as one of the first refinements of polished societies certainly sir and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world every savage can dance sir william only smiled your friend performs delightfully he continued after a pause on seeing bingley join the group and i doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself mr darcy you saw me dance at meryton i believe sir yes indeed and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight do you often dance at st james s never sir do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place it is a compliment which i never pay to any place if i can avoid it you have a house in town i conclude mr darcy bowed i had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself for i am fond of superior society but i did not feel quite certain that the air of london would agree with lady lucas he paused in hopes of an answer but his companion was not disposed to make any and elizabeth at that instant moving towards them he was struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing and called out to her my dear miss eliza why are not you dancing mr darcy you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner you cannot refuse to dance i am sure when so much beauty is before you and taking her hand he would have given it to mr darcy who though extremely surprised was not unwilling to receive it when she instantly drew back and said with some discomposure to sir william indeed sir i have not the least intention of dancing i entreat you not to suppose that i moved this way in order to beg for a partner mr darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her hand but in vain elizabeth was determined nor did sir william at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion you excel so much in the dance miss eliza that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general he can have no objection i am sure to oblige us for one half hour mr darcy is all politeness said elizabeth smiling he is indeed but considering the inducement my dear miss eliza we cannot wonder at his complaisance for who would object to such a partner elizabeth looked archly and turned away her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman and he was thinking of her with some complacency when thus accosted by miss bingley i can guess the subject of your reverie i should imagine not you are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner in such society and indeed i am quite of your opinion i was never more annoyed the insipidity and yet the noise the nothingness and yet the self importance of all these people what would i give to hear your strictures on them your conjecture is totally wrong i assure you my mind was more agreeably engaged i have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow miss bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections mr darcy replied with great intrepidity miss elizabeth bennet miss elizabeth bennet repeated miss bingley i am all astonishment how long has she been such a favourite and pray when am i to wish you joy that is exactly the question which i expected you to ask a lady s imagination is very rapid it jumps from admiration to love from love to matrimony in a moment i knew you would be wishing me joy nay if you are so serious about it i shall consider the matter as absolutely settled you will have a charming mother in law indeed and of course she will be always at pemberley with you he listened to her with perfect indifference while she chose to entertain herself in this manner and as his composure convinced her that all was safe her wit flowed along illustration a note for miss bennet copyright by george allen chapter vii illustration mr bennet s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year which unfortunately for his daughters was entailed in default of heirs male on a distant relation and their mother s fortune though ample for her situation in life could but ill supply the deficiency of his her father had been an attorney in meryton and had left her four thousand pounds she had a sister married to a mr philips who had been a clerk to their father and succeeded him in the business and a brother settled in london in a respectable line of trade the village of longbourn was only one mile from meryton a most convenient distance for the young ladies who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliner s shop just over the way the two youngest of the family catherine and lydia were particularly frequent in these attentions their minds were more vacant than their sisters and when nothing better offered a walk to meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening and however bare of news the country in general might be they always contrived to learn some from their aunt at present indeed they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood it was to remain the whole winter and meryton was the head quarters their visits to mrs philips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence every day added something to their knowledge of the officers names and connections their lodgings were not long a secret and at length they began to know the officers themselves mr philips visited them all and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before they could talk of nothing but officers and mr bingley s large fortune the mention of which gave animation to their mother was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign after listening one morning to their effusions on this subject mr bennet coolly observed from all that i can collect by your manner of talking you must be two of the silliest girls in the country i have suspected it some time but i am now convinced catherine was disconcerted and made no answer but lydia with perfect indifference continued to express her admiration of captain carter and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day as he was going the next morning to london i am astonished my dear said mrs bennet that you should be so ready to think your own children silly if i wished to think slightingly of anybody s children it should not be of my own however if my children are silly i must hope to be always sensible of it yes but as it happens they are all of them very clever this is the only point i flatter myself on which we do not agree i had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular but i must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish my dear mr bennet you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother when they get to our age i dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do i remember the time when i liked a red coat myself very well and indeed so i do still at my heart and if a smart young colonel with five or six thousand a year should want one of my girls i shall not say nay to him and i thought colonel forster looked very becoming the other night at sir william s in his regimentals mamma cried lydia my aunt says that colonel forster and captain carter do not go so often to miss watson s as they did when they first came she sees them now very often standing in clarke s library mrs bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for miss bennet it came from netherfield and the servant waited for an answer mrs bennet s eyes sparkled with pleasure and she was eagerly calling out while her daughter read well jane who is it from what is it about what does he say well jane make haste and tell us make haste my love it is from miss bingley said jane and then read it aloud nind my dear friend if you are not so compassionate as to dine to day with louisa and me we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives for a whole day s t te t te between two women can never end without a quarrel come as soon as you can on the receipt of this my brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers yours ever caroline bingley with the officers cried lydia i wonder my aunt did not tell us of that dining out said mrs bennet that is very unlucky can i have the carriage said jane no my dear you had better go on horseback because it seems likely to rain and then you must stay all night that would be a good scheme said elizabeth if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home oh but the gentlemen will have mr bingley s chaise to go to meryton and the hursts have no horses to theirs i had much rather go in the coach but my dear your father cannot spare the horses i am sure they are wanted in the farm mr bennet are not they illustration cheerful prognostics they are wanted in the farm much oftener than i can get them but if you have got them to day said elizabeth my mother s purpose will be answered she did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad day her hopes were answered jane had not been gone long before it rained hard her sisters were uneasy for her but her mother was delighted the rain continued the whole evening without intermission jane certainly could not come back this was a lucky idea of mine indeed said mrs bennet more than once as if the credit of making it rain were all her own till the next morning however she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from netherfield brought the following note for elizabeth nind my dearest lizzie i find myself very unwell this morning which i suppose is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday my kind friends will not hear of my returning home till i am better they insist also on my seeing mr jones therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to me and excepting a sore throat and a headache there is not much the matter with me yours etc well my dear said mr bennet when elizabeth had read the note aloud if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness if she should die it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of mr bingley and under your orders oh i am not at all afraid of her dying people do not die of little trifling colds she will be taken good care of as long as she stays there it is all very well i would go and see her if i could have the carriage elizabeth feeling really anxious determined to go to her though the carriage was not to be had and as she was no horsewoman walking was her only alternative she declared her resolution how can you be so silly cried her mother as to think of such a thing in all this dirt you will not be fit to be seen when you get there i shall be very fit to see jane which is all i want is this a hint to me lizzy said her father to send for the horses no indeed i do not wish to avoid the walk the distance is nothing when one has a motive only three miles i shall be back by dinner i admire the activity of your benevolence observed mary but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason and in my opinion exertion should always be in proportion to what is required we will go as far as meryton with you said catherine and lydia elizabeth accepted their company and the three young ladies set off together if we make haste said lydia as they walked along perhaps we may see something of captain carter before he goes in meryton they parted the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers wives and elizabeth continued her walk alone crossing field after field at a quick pace jumping over stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity and finding herself at last within view of the house with weary ancles dirty stockings and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise she was shown into the breakfast parlour where all but jane were assembled and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise that she should have walked three miles so early in the day in such dirty weather and by herself was almost incredible to mrs hurst and miss bingley and elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it she was received however very politely by them and in their brother s manners there was something better than politeness there was good humour and kindness mr darcy said very little and mr hurst nothing at all the former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion and doubt as to the occasion s justifying her coming so far alone the latter was thinking only of his breakfast her inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered miss bennet had slept ill and though up was very feverish and not well enough to leave her room elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately and jane who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit was delighted at her entrance she was not equal however to much conversation and when miss bingley left them together could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with elizabeth silently attended her when breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters and elizabeth began to like them herself when she saw how much affection and solicitude they showed for jane the apothecary came and having examined his patient said as might be supposed that she had caught a violent cold and that they must endeavour to get the better of it advised her to return to bed and promised her some draughts the advice was followed readily for the feverish symptoms increased and her head ached acutely elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment nor were the other ladies often absent the gentlemen being out they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere when the clock struck three elizabeth felt that she must go and very unwillingly said so miss bingley offered her the carriage and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it when jane testified such concern at parting with her that miss bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise into an invitation to remain at netherfield for the present elizabeth most thankfully consented and a servant was despatched to longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay and bring back a supply of clothes illustration the apothecary came illustration covering a screen chapter viii illustration at five o clock the two ladies retired to dress and at half past six elizabeth was summoned to dinner to the civil inquiries which then poured in and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of mr bingley she could not make a very favourable answer jane was by no means better the sisters on hearing this repeated three or four times how much they were grieved how shocking it was to have a bad cold and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves and then thought no more of the matter and their indifference towards jane when not immediately before them restored elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike their brother indeed was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency his anxiety for jane was evident and his attentions to herself most pleasing and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others she had very little notice from any but him miss bingley was engrossed by mr darcy her sister scarcely less so and as for mr hurst by whom elizabeth sat he was an indolent man who lived only to eat drink and play at cards who when he found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout had nothing to say to her when dinner was over she returned directly to jane and miss bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed a mixture of pride and impertinence she had no conversation no style no taste no beauty mrs hurst thought the same and added she has nothing in short to recommend her but being an excellent walker i shall never forget her appearance this morning she really looked almost wild she did indeed louisa i could hardly keep my countenance very nonsensical to come at all why must she be scampering about the country because her sister had a cold her hair so untidy so blowzy yes and her petticoat i hope you saw her petticoat six inches deep in mud i am absolutely certain and the gown which had been let down to hide it not doing its office your picture may be very exact louisa said bingley but this was all lost upon me i thought miss elizabeth bennet looked remarkably well when she came into the room this morning her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice you observed it mr darcy i am sure said miss bingley and i am inclined to think that you would not wish to see your sister make such an exhibition certainly not to walk three miles or four miles or five miles or whatever it is above her ancles in dirt and alone quite alone what could she mean by it it seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence a most country town indifference to decorum it shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing said bingley i am afraid mr darcy observed miss bingley in a half whisper that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes not at all he replied they were brightened by the exercise a short pause followed this speech and mrs hurst began again i have an excessive regard for jane bennet she is really a very sweet girl and i wish with all my heart she were well settled but with such a father and mother and such low connections i am afraid there is no chance of it i think i have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in meryton yes and they have another who lives somewhere near cheapside that is capital added her sister and they both laughed heartily if they had uncles enough to fill all cheapside cried bingley it would not make them one jot less agreeable but it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world replied darcy to this speech bingley made no answer but his sisters gave it their hearty assent and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friend s vulgar relations with a renewal of tenderness however they repaired to her room on leaving the dining parlour and sat with her till summoned to coffee she was still very poorly and elizabeth would not quit her at all till late in the evening when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep and when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go down stairs herself on entering the drawing room she found the whole party at loo and was immediately invited to join them but suspecting them to be playing high she declined it and making her sister the excuse said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay below with a book mr hurst looked at her with astonishment do you prefer reading to cards said he that is rather singular miss eliza bennet said miss bingley despises cards she is a great reader and has no pleasure in anything else i deserve neither such praise nor such censure cried elizabeth i am not a great reader and i have pleasure in many things in nursing your sister i am sure you have pleasure said bingley and i hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well elizabeth thanked him from her heart and then walked towards a table where a few books were lying he immediately offered to fetch her others all that his library afforded and i wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit but i am an idle fellow and though i have not many i have more than i ever looked into elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room i am astonished said miss bingley that my father should have left so small a collection of books what a delightful library you have at pemberley mr darcy it ought to be good he replied it has been the work of many generations and then you have added so much to it yourself you are always buying books i cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these neglect i am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place charles when you build your house i wish it may be half as delightful as pemberley i wish it may but i would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood and take pemberley for a kind of model there is not a finer county in england than derbyshire with all my heart i will buy pemberley itself if darcy will sell it i am talking of possibilities charles upon my word caroline i should think it more possible to get pemberley by purchase than by imitation elizabeth was so much caught by what passed as to leave her very little attention for her book and soon laying it wholly aside she drew near the card table and stationed herself between mr bingley and his eldest sister to observe the game is miss darcy much grown since the spring said miss bingley will she be as tall as i am i think she will she is now about miss elizabeth bennet s height or rather taller how i long to see her again i never met with anybody who delighted me so much such a countenance such manners and so extremely accomplished for her age her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite it is amazing to me said bingley how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished as they all are all young ladies accomplished my dear charles what do you mean yes all of them i think they all paint tables cover screens and net purses i scarcely know any one who cannot do all this and i am sure i never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time without being informed that she was very accomplished your list of the common extent of accomplishments said darcy has too much truth the word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen but i am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general i cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen in the whole range of my acquaintance that are really accomplished nor i i am sure said miss bingley then observed elizabeth you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman yes i do comprehend a great deal in it oh certainly cried his faithful assistant no one can be really esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with a woman must have a thorough knowledge of music singing drawing dancing and the modern languages to deserve the word and besides all this she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking the tone of her voice her address and expressions or the word will be but half deserved all this she must possess added darcy and to all she must yet add something more substantial in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading i am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women i rather wonder now at your knowing any are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all this i never saw such a woman i never saw such capacity and taste and application and elegance as you describe united mrs hurst and miss bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description when mr hurst called them to order with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward as all conversation was thereby at an end elizabeth soon afterwards left the room eliza bennet said miss bingley when the door was closed on her is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex by undervaluing their own and with many men i daresay it succeeds but in my opinion it is a paltry device a very mean art undoubtedly replied darcy to whom this remark was chiefly addressed there is meanness in all the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable miss bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse and that she could not leave her bingley urged mr jones s being sent for immediately while his sisters convinced that no country advice could be of any service recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians this she would not hear of but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brother s proposal and it was settled that mr jones should be sent for early in the morning if miss bennet were not decidedly better bingley was quite uncomfortable his sisters declared that they were miserable they solaced their wretchedness however by duets after supper while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister illustration m rs bennet and her two youngest girls copyright by george allen chapter ix illustration elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister s room and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the inquiries which she very early received from mr bingley by a housemaid and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters in spite of this amendment however she requested to have a note sent to longbourn desiring her mother to visit jane and form her own judgment of her situation the note was immediately despatched and its contents as quickly complied with mrs bennet accompanied by her two youngest girls reached netherfield soon after the family breakfast had she found jane in any apparent danger mrs bennet would have been very miserable but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming she had no wish of her recovering immediately as her restoration to health would probably remove her from netherfield she would not listen therefore to her daughter s proposal of being carried home neither did the apothecary who arrived about the same time think it at all advisable after sitting a little while with jane on miss bingley s appearance and invitation the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour bingley met them with hopes that mrs bennet had not found miss bennet worse than she expected indeed i have sir was her answer she is a great deal too ill to be moved mr jones says we must not think of moving her we must trespass a little longer on your kindness removed cried bingley it must not be thought of my sister i am sure will not hear of her removal you may depend upon it madam said miss bingley with cold civility that miss bennet shall receive every possible attention while she remains with us mrs bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments i am sure she added if it was not for such good friends i do not know what would become of her for she is very ill indeed and suffers a vast deal though with the greatest patience in the world which is always the way with her for she has without exception the sweetest temper i ever met with i often tell my other girls they are nothing to her you have a sweet room here mr bingley and a charming prospect over that gravel walk i do not know a place in the country that is equal to netherfield you will not think of quitting it in a hurry i hope though you have but a short lease whatever i do is done in a hurry replied he and therefore if i should resolve to quit netherfield i should probably be off in five minutes at present however i consider myself as quite fixed here that is exactly what i should have supposed of you said elizabeth you begin to comprehend me do you cried he turning towards her oh yes i understand you perfectly i wish i might take this for a compliment but to be so easily seen through i am afraid is pitiful that is as it happens it does not necessarily follow that a deep intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours lizzy cried her mother remember where you are and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home i did not know before continued bingley immediately that you were a studier of character it must be an amusing study yes but intricate characters are the most amusing they have at least that advantage the country said darcy can in general supply but few subjects for such a study in a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society but people themselves alter so much that there is something new to be observed in them for ever yes indeed cried mrs bennet offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood i assure you there is quite as much of that going on in the country as in town everybody was surprised and darcy after looking at her for a moment turned silently away mrs bennet who fancied she had gained a complete victory over him continued her triumph i cannot see that london has any great advantage over the country for my part except the shops and public places the country is a vast deal pleasanter is not it mr bingley when i am in the country he replied i never wish to leave it and when i am in town it is pretty much the same they have each their advantages and i can be equally happy in either ay that is because you have the right disposition but that gentleman looking at darcy seemed to think the country was nothing at all indeed mamma you are mistaken said elizabeth blushing for her mother you quite mistook mr darcy he only meant that there was not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town which you must acknowledge to be true certainly my dear nobody said there were but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood i believe there are few neighbourhoods larger i know we dine with four and twenty families nothing but concern for elizabeth could enable bingley to keep his countenance his sister was less delicate and directed her eye towards mr darcy with a very expressive smile elizabeth for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother s thoughts now asked her if charlotte lucas had been at longbourn since her coming away yes she called yesterday with her father what an agreeable man sir william is mr bingley is not he so much the man of fashion so genteel and so easy he has always something to say to everybody that is my idea of good breeding and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths quite mistake the matter did charlotte dine with you no she would go home i fancy she was wanted about the mince pies for my part mr bingley i always keep servants that can do their own work my daughters are brought up differently but everybody is to judge for themselves and the lucases are a very good sort of girls i assure you it is a pity they are not handsome not that i think charlotte so very plain but then she is our particular friend she seems a very pleasant young woman said bingley oh dear yes but you must own she is very plain lady lucas herself has often said so and envied me jane s beauty i do not like to boast of my own child but to be sure jane one does not often see anybody better looking it is what everybody says i do not trust my own partiality when she was only fifteen there was a gentleman at my brother gardiner s in town so much in love with her that my sister in law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away but however he did not perhaps he thought her too young however he wrote some verses on her and very pretty they were and so ended his affection said elizabeth impatiently there has been many a one i fancy overcome in the same way i wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love i have been used to consider poetry as the food of love said darcy of a fine stout healthy love it may everything nourishes what is strong already but if it be only a slight thin sort of inclination i am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away darcy only smiled and the general pause which ensued made elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again she longed to speak but could think of nothing to say and after a short silence mrs bennet began repeating her thanks to mr bingley for his kindness to jane with an apology for troubling him also with lizzy mr bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer and forced his younger sister to be civil also and say what the occasion required she performed her part indeed without much graciousness but mrs bennet was satisfied and soon afterwards ordered her carriage upon this signal the youngest of her daughters put herself forward the two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit and the result of it was that the youngest should tax mr bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at netherfield lydia was a stout well grown girl of fifteen with a fine complexion and good humoured countenance a favourite with her mother whose affection had brought her into public at an early age she had high animal spirits and a sort of natural self consequence which the attentions of the officers to whom her uncle s good dinners and her own easy manners recommended her had increased into assurance she was very equal therefore to address mr bingley on the subject of the ball and abruptly reminded him of his promise adding that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it his answer to this sudden attack was delightful to her mother s ear i am perfectly ready i assure you to keep my engagement and when your sister is recovered you shall if you please name the very day of the ball but you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill lydia declared herself satisfied oh yes it would be much better to wait till jane was well and by that time most likely captain carter would be at meryton again and when you have given your ball she added i shall insist on their giving one also i shall tell colonel forster it will be quite a shame if he does not mrs bennet and her daughters then departed and elizabeth returned instantly to jane leaving her own and her relations behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and mr darcy the latter of whom however could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of her in spite of all miss bingley s witticisms on fine eyes illustration chapter x illustration the day passed much as the day before had done mrs hurst and miss bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid who continued though slowly to mend and in the evening elizabeth joined their party in the drawing room the loo table however did not appear mr darcy was writing and miss bingley seated near him was watching the progress of his letter and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to his sister mr hurst and mr bingley were at piquet and mrs hurst was observing their game elizabeth took up some needlework and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between darcy and his companion the perpetual commendations of the lady either on his hand writing or on the evenness of his lines or on the length of his letter with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received formed a curious dialogue and was exactly in unison with her opinion of each how delighted miss darcy will be to receive such a letter he made no answer you write uncommonly fast you are mistaken i write rather slowly how many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of a year letters of business too how odious i should think them it is fortunate then that they fall to my lot instead of to yours pray tell your sister that i long to see her i have already told her so once by your desire i am afraid you do not like your pen let me mend it for you i mend pens remarkably well thank you but i always mend my own how can you contrive to write so even he was silent tell your sister i am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp and pray let her know that i am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table and i think it infinitely superior to miss grantley s will you give me leave to defer your raptures till i write again at present i have not room to do them justice oh it is of no consequence i shall see her in january but do you always write such charming long letters to her mr darcy they are generally long but whether always charming it is not for me to determine it is a rule with me that a person who can write a long letter with ease cannot write ill that will not do for a compliment to darcy caroline cried her brother because he does not write with ease he studies too much for words of four syllables do not you darcy my style of writing is very different from yours oh cried miss bingley charles writes in the most careless way imaginable he leaves out half his words and blots the rest my ideas flow so rapidly that i have not time to express them by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents your humility mr bingley said elizabeth must disarm reproof nothing is more deceitful said darcy than the appearance of humility it is often only carelessness of opinion and sometimes an indirect boast and which of the two do you call my little recent piece of modesty the indirect boast for you are really proud of your defects in writing because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution which if not estimable you think at least highly interesting the power of doing anything with quickness is always much prized by the possessor and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance when you told mrs bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting netherfield you should be gone in five minutes you meant it to be a sort of panegyric of compliment to yourself and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else nay cried bingley this is too much to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning and yet upon my honour i believed what i said of myself to be true and i believe it at this moment at least therefore i did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to show off before the ladies i daresay you believed it but i am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity your conduct would be quite as dependent on chance as that of any man i know and if as you were mounting your horse a friend were to say bingley you had better stay till next week you would probably do it you would probably not go and at another word might stay a month you have only proved by this cried elizabeth that mr bingley did not do justice to his own disposition you have shown him off now much more than he did himself i am exceedingly gratified said bingley by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper but i am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend for he would certainly think the better of me if under such a circumstance i were to give a flat denial and ride off as fast as i could would mr darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it upon my word i cannot exactly explain the matter darcy must speak for himself you expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call mine but which i have never acknowledged allowing the case however to stand according to your representation you must remember miss bennet that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house and the delay of his plan has merely desired it asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety to yield readily easily to the persuasion of a friend is no merit with you to yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either you appear to me mr darcy to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection a regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request without waiting for arguments to reason one into it i am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about mr bingley we may as well wait perhaps till the circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon but in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire without waiting to be argued into it will it not be advisable before we proceed on this subject to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties by all means cried bingley let us hear all the particulars not forgetting their comparative height and size for that will have more weight in the argument miss bennet than you may be aware of i assure you that if darcy were not such a great tall fellow in comparison with myself i should not pay him half so much deference i declare i do not know a more awful object than darcy on particular occasions and in particular places at his own house especially and of a sunday evening when he has nothing to do mr darcy smiled but elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended and therefore checked her laugh miss bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense i see your design bingley said his friend you dislike an argument and want to silence this perhaps i do arguments are too much like disputes if you and miss bennet will defer yours till i am out of the room i shall be very thankful and then you may say whatever you like of me what you ask said elizabeth is no sacrifice on my side and mr darcy had much better finish his letter mr darcy took her advice and did finish his letter when that business was over he applied to miss bingley and elizabeth for the indulgence of some music miss bingley moved with alacrity to the pianoforte and after a polite request that elizabeth would lead the way which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived she seated herself mrs hurst sang with her sister and while they were thus employed elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books that lay on the instrument how frequently mr darcy s eyes were fixed on her she hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her was still more strange she could only imagine however at last that she drew his notice because there was something about her more wrong and reprehensible according to his ideas of right than in any other person present the supposition did not pain her she liked him too little to care for his approbation after playing some italian songs miss bingley varied the charm by a lively scotch air and soon afterwards mr darcy drawing near elizabeth said to her do you not feel a great inclination miss bennet to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel she smiled but made no answer he repeated the question with some surprise at her silence oh said she i heard you before but i could not immediately determine what to say in reply you wanted me i know to say yes that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste but i always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt i have therefore made up my mind to tell you that i do not want to dance a reel at all and now despise me if you dare indeed i do not dare elizabeth having rather expected to affront him was amazed at his gallantry but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody and darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her he really believed that were it not for the inferiority of her connections he should be in some danger miss bingley saw or suspected enough to be jealous and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend jane received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of elizabeth she often tried to provoke darcy into disliking her guest by talking of their supposed marriage and planning his happiness in such an alliance i hope said she as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day you will give your mother in law a few hints when this desirable event takes place as to the advantage of holding her tongue and if you can compass it to cure the younger girls of running after the officers and if i may mention so delicate a subject endeavour to check that little something bordering on conceit and impertinence which your lady possesses illustration no no stay where you are copyright by george allen have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity oh yes do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt philips be placed in the gallery at pemberley put them next to your great uncle the judge they are in the same profession you know only in different lines as for your elizabeth s picture you must not attempt to have it taken for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes it would not be easy indeed to catch their expression but their colour and shape and the eyelashes so remarkably fine might be copied at that moment they were met from another walk by mrs hurst and elizabeth herself i did not know that you intended to walk said miss bingley in some confusion lest they had been overheard you used us abominably ill answered mrs hurst running away without telling us that you were coming out then taking the disengaged arm of mr darcy she left elizabeth to walk by herself the path just admitted three mr darcy felt their rudeness and immediately said this walk is not wide enough for our party we had better go into the avenue but elizabeth who had not the least inclination to remain with them laughingly answered no no stay where you are you are charmingly grouped and appear to uncommon advantage the picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth good bye she then ran gaily off rejoicing as she rambled about in the hope of being at home again in a day or two jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening illustration piling up the fire copyright by george allen chapter xi illustration when the ladies removed after dinner elizabeth ran up to her sister and seeing her well guarded from cold attended her into the drawing room where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure and elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared their powers of conversation were considerable they could describe an entertainment with accuracy relate an anecdote with humour and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit but when the gentlemen entered jane was no longer the first object miss bingley s eyes were instantly turned towards darcy and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps he addressed himself directly to miss bennet with a polite congratulation mr hurst also made her a slight bow and said he was very glad but diffuseness and warmth remained for bingley s salutation he was full of joy and attention the first half hour was spent in piling up the fire lest she should suffer from the change of room and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fireplace that she might be farther from the door he then sat down by her and talked scarcely to anyone else elizabeth at work in the opposite corner saw it all with great delight when tea was over mr hurst reminded his sister in law of the card table but in vain she had obtained private intelligence that mr darcy did not wish for cards and mr hurst soon found even his open petition rejected she assured him that no one intended to play and the silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her mr hurst had therefore nothing to do but to stretch himself on one of the sofas and go to sleep darcy took up a book miss bingley did the same and mrs hurst principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings joined now and then in her brother s conversation with miss bennet miss bingley s attention was quite as much engaged in watching mr darcy s progress through his book as in reading her own and she was perpetually either making some inquiry or looking at his page she could not win him however to any conversation he merely answered her question and read on at length quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his she gave a great yawn and said how pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way i declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading how much sooner one tires of anything than of a book when i have a house of my own i shall be miserable if i have not an excellent library no one made any reply she then yawned again threw aside her book and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to miss bennet she turned suddenly towards him and said by the bye charles are you really serious in meditating a dance at netherfield i would advise you before you determine on it to consult the wishes of the present party i am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure if you mean darcy cried her brother he may go to bed if he chooses before it begins but as for the ball it is quite a settled thing and as soon as nicholls has made white soup enough i shall send round my cards i should like balls infinitely better she replied if they were carried on in a different manner but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting it would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day much more rational my dear caroline i dare say but it would not be near so much like a ball miss bingley made no answer and soon afterwards got up and walked about the room her figure was elegant and she walked well but darcy at whom it was all aimed was still inflexibly studious in the desperation of her feelings she resolved on one effort more and turning to elizabeth said miss eliza bennet let me persuade you to follow my example and take a turn about the room i assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude elizabeth was surprised but agreed to it immediately miss bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility mr darcy looked up he was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as elizabeth herself could be and unconsciously closed his book he was directly invited to join their party but he declined it observing that he could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and down the room together with either of which motives his joining them would interfere what could he mean she was dying to know what could be his meaning and asked elizabeth whether she could at all understand him not at all was her answer but depend upon it he means to be severe on us and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing about it miss bingley however was incapable of disappointing mr darcy in anything and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives i have not the smallest objection to explaining them said he as soon as she allowed him to speak you either choose this method of passing the evening because you are in each other s confidence and have secret affairs to discuss or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking if the first i should be completely in your way and if the second i can admire you much better as i sit by the fire oh shocking cried miss bingley i never heard anything so abominable how shall we punish him for such a speech nothing so easy if you have but the inclination said elizabeth we can all plague and punish one another tease him laugh at him intimate as you are you must know how it is to be done but upon my honour i do not i do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me that tease calmness of temper and presence of mind no no i feel he may defy us there and as to laughter we will not expose ourselves if you please by attempting to laugh without a subject mr darcy may hug himself mr darcy is not to be laughed at cried elizabeth that is an uncommon advantage and uncommon i hope it will continue for it would be a great loss to me to have many such acquaintance i dearly love a laugh miss bingley said he has given me credit for more than can be the wisest and best of men nay the wisest and best of their actions may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke certainly replied elizabeth there are such people but i hope i am not one of them i hope i never ridicule what is wise or good follies and nonsense whims and inconsistencies do divert me i own and i laugh at them whenever i can but these i suppose are precisely what you are without perhaps that is not possible for anyone but it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule such as vanity and pride yes vanity is a weakness indeed but pride where there is a real superiority of mind pride will be always under good regulation elizabeth turned away to hide a smile your examination of mr darcy is over i presume said miss bingley and pray what is the result i am perfectly convinced by it that mr darcy has no defect he owns it himself without disguise no said darcy i have made no such pretension i have faults enough but they are not i hope of understanding my temper i dare not vouch for it is i believe too little yielding certainly too little for the convenience of the world i cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as i ought nor their offences against myself my feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them my temper would perhaps be called resentful my good opinion once lost is lost for ever that is a failing indeed cried elizabeth implacable resentment is a shade in a character but you have chosen your fault well i really cannot laugh at it you are safe from me there is i believe in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil a natural defect which not even the best education can overcome and your defect is a propensity to hate everybody and yours he replied with a smile is wilfully to misunderstand them do let us have a little music cried miss bingley tired of a conversation in which she had no share louisa you will not mind my waking mr hurst her sister made not the smallest objection and the pianoforte was opened and darcy after a few moments recollection was not sorry for it he began to feel the danger of paying elizabeth too much attention illustration chapter xii illustration in consequence of an agreement between the sisters elizabeth wrote the next morning to her mother to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day but mrs bennet who had calculated on her daughters remaining at netherfield till the following tuesday which would exactly finish jane s week could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before her answer therefore was not propitious at least not to elizabeth s wishes for she was impatient to get home mrs bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before tuesday and in her postscript it was added that if mr bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer she could spare them very well against staying longer however elizabeth was positively resolved nor did she much expect it would be asked and fearful on the contrary of being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long she urged jane to borrow mr bingley s carriage immediately and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving netherfield that morning should be mentioned and the request made the communication excited many professions of concern and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on jane and till the morrow their going was deferred miss bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other the master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon and repeatedly tried to persuade miss bennet that it would not be safe for her that she was not enough recovered but jane was firm where she felt herself to be right to mr darcy it was welcome intelligence elizabeth had been at netherfield long enough she attracted him more than he liked and miss bingley was uncivil to her and more teasing than usual to himself he wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should now escape him nothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity sensible that if such an idea had been suggested his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it steady to his purpose he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of saturday and though they were at one time left by themselves for half an hour he adhered most conscientiously to his book and would not even look at her on sunday after morning service the separation so agreeable to almost all took place miss bingley s civility to elizabeth increased at last very rapidly as well as her affection for jane and when they parted after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at longbourn or netherfield and embracing her most tenderly she even shook hands with the former elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest spirits they were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother mrs bennet wondered at their coming and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble and was sure jane would have caught cold again but their father though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure was really glad to see them he had felt their importance in the family circle the evening conversation when they were all assembled had lost much of its animation and almost all its sense by the absence of jane and elizabeth they found mary as usual deep in the study of thorough bass and human nature and had some new extracts to admire and some new observations of threadbare morality to listen to catherine and lydia had information for them of a different sort much had been done and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding wednesday several of the officers had dined lately with their uncle a private had been flogged and it had actually been hinted that colonel forster was going to be married illustration chapter xiii illustration i hope my dear said mr bennet to his wife as they were at breakfast the next morning that you have ordered a good dinner to day because i have reason to expect an addition to our family party who do you mean my dear i know of nobody that is coming i am sure unless charlotte lucas should happen to call in and i hope my dinners are good enough for her i do not believe she often sees such at home the person of whom i speak is a gentleman and a stranger mrs bennet s eyes sparkled a gentleman and a stranger it is mr bingley i am sure why jane you never dropped a word of this you sly thing well i am sure i shall be extremely glad to see mr bingley but good lord how unlucky there is not a bit of fish to be got to day lydia my love ring the bell i must speak to hill this moment it is not mr bingley said her husband it is a person whom i never saw in the whole course of my life this roused a general astonishment and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once after amusing himself some time with their curiosity he thus explained about a month ago i received this letter and about a fortnight ago i answered it for i thought it a case of some delicacy and requiring early attention it is from my cousin mr collins who when i am dead may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases oh my dear cried his wife i cannot bear to hear that mentioned pray do not talk of that odious man i do think it is the hardest thing in the world that your estate should be entailed away from your own children and i am sure if i had been you i should have tried long ago to do something or other about it jane and elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail they had often attempted it before but it was a subject on which mrs bennet was beyond the reach of reason and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about it certainly is a most iniquitous affair said mr bennet and nothing can clear mr collins from the guilt of inheriting longbourn but if you will listen to his letter you may perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself no that i am sure i shall not and i think it was very impertinent of him to write to you at all and very hypocritical i hate such false friends why could not he keep on quarrelling with you as his father did before him why indeed he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head as you will hear right hunsford near westerham kent th october dear sir the disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father always gave me much uneasiness and since i have had the misfortune to lose him i have frequently wished to heal the breach but for some time i was kept back by my own doubts fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with anyone with whom it had always pleased him to be at variance there mrs bennet my mind however is now made up on the subject for having received ordination at easter i have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the right honourable lady catherine de bourgh widow of sir lewis de bourgh whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her ladyship and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the church of england as a clergyman moreover i feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence and on these grounds i flatter myself that my present overtures of good will are highly commendable and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on your side and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch i cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your amiable daughters and beg leave to apologize for it as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends but of this hereafter if you should have no objection to receive me into your house i propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family monday november th by four o clock and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the saturday se nnight following which i can do without any inconvenience as lady catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a sunday provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day i remain dear sir with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters your well wisher and friend william collins at four o clock therefore we may expect this peace making gentleman said mr bennet as he folded up the letter he seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man upon my word and i doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance especially if lady catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again there is some sense in what he says about the girls however and if he is disposed to make them any amends i shall not be the person to discourage him though it is difficult said jane to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due the wish is certainly to his credit elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for lady catherine and his kind intention of christening marrying and burying his parishioners whenever it were required he must be an oddity i think said she i cannot make him out there is something very pompous in his style and what can he mean by apologizing for being next in the entail we cannot suppose he would help it if he could can he be a sensible man sir no my dear i think not i have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse there is a mixture of servility and self importance in his letter which promises well i am impatient to see him in point of composition said mary his letter does not seem defective the idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new yet i think it is well expressed to catherine and lydia neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting it was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour as for their mother mr collins s letter had done away much of her ill will and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which astonished her husband and daughters mr collins was punctual to his time and was received with great politeness by the whole family mr bennet indeed said little but the ladies were ready enough to talk and mr collins seemed neither in need of encouragement nor inclined to be silent himself he was a tall heavy looking young man of five and twenty his air was grave and stately and his manners were very formal he had not been long seated before he complimented mrs bennet on having so fine a family of daughters said he had heard much of their beauty but that in this instance fame had fallen short of the truth and added that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage this gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers but mrs bennet who quarrelled with no compliments answered most readily you are very kind sir i am sure and i wish with all my heart it may prove so for else they will be destitute enough things are settled so oddly you allude perhaps to the entail of this estate ah sir i do indeed it is a grievous affair to my poor girls you must confess not that i mean to find fault with you for such things i know are all chance in this world there is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed i am very sensible madam of the hardship to my fair cousins and could say much on the subject but that i am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate but i can assure the young ladies that i come prepared to admire them at present i will not say more but perhaps when we are better acquainted he was interrupted by a summons to dinner and the girls smiled on each other they were not the only objects of mr collins s admiration the hall the dining room and all its furniture were examined and praised and his commendation of everything would have touched mrs bennet s heart but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property the dinner too in its turn was highly admired and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins the excellence of its cookery was owing but here he was set right by mrs bennet who assured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good cook and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen he begged pardon for having displeased her in a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended but he continued to apologize for about a quarter of an hour illustration chapter xiv illustration during dinner mr bennet scarcely spoke at all but when the servants were withdrawn he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness lady catherine de bourgh s attention to his wishes and consideration for his comfort appeared very remarkable mr bennet could not have chosen better mr collins was eloquent in her praise the subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner and with a most important aspect he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank such affability and condescension as he had himself experienced from lady catherine she had been graciously pleased to approve of both the discourses which he had already had the honour of preaching before her she had also asked him twice to dine at rosings and had sent for him only the saturday before to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening lady catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew but he had never seen anything but affability in her she had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or two to visit his relations she had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could provided he chose with discretion and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself some shelves in the closets upstairs that is all very proper and civil i am sure said mrs bennet and i dare say she is a very agreeable woman it is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her does she live near you sir the garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane from rosings park her ladyship s residence i think you said she was a widow sir has she any family she has one only daughter the heiress of rosings and of very extensive property ah cried mrs bennet shaking her head then she is better off than many girls and what sort of young lady is she is she handsome she is a most charming young lady indeed lady catherine herself says that in point of true beauty miss de bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex because there is that in her features which marks the young woman of distinguished birth she is unfortunately of a sickly constitution which has prevented her making that progress in many accomplishments which she could not otherwise have failed of as i am informed by the lady who superintended her education and who still resides with them but she is perfectly amiable and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies has she been presented i do not remember her name among the ladies at court her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town and by that means as i told lady catherine myself one day has deprived the british court of its brightest ornament her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea and you may imagine that i am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies i have more than once observed to lady catherine that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess and that the most elevated rank instead of giving her consequence would be adorned by her these are the kind of little things which please her ladyship and it is a sort of attention which i conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay you judge very properly said mr bennet and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy may i ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment or are the result of previous study they arise chiefly from what is passing at the time and though i sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions i always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible mr bennet s expectations were fully answered his cousin was as absurd as he had hoped and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance and except in an occasional glance at elizabeth requiring no partner in his pleasure by tea time however the dose had been enough and mr bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawing room again and when tea was over glad to invite him illustration protested that he never read novels h t feb to read aloud to the ladies mr collins readily assented and a book was produced but on beholding it for everything announced it to be from a circulating library he started back and begging pardon protested that he never read novels kitty stared at him and lydia exclaimed other books were produced and after some deliberation he chose fordyce s sermons lydia gaped as he opened the volume and before he had with very monotonous solemnity read three pages she interrupted him with do you know mamma that my uncle philips talks of turning away richard and if he does colonel forster will hire him my aunt told me so herself on saturday i shall walk to meryton to morrow to hear more about it and to ask when mr denny comes back from town lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue but mr collins much offended laid aside his book and said i have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp though written solely for their benefit it amazes me i confess for certainly there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction but i will no longer importune my young cousin then turning to mr bennet he offered himself as his antagonist at backgammon mr bennet accepted the challenge observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements mrs bennet and her daughters apologized most civilly for lydia s interruption and promised that it should not occur again if he would resume his book but mr collins after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill will and should never resent her behaviour as any affront seated himself at another table with mr bennet and prepared for backgammon illustration chapter xv illustration mr collins was not a sensible man and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly father and though he belonged to one of the universities he had merely kept the necessary terms without forming at it any useful acquaintance the subjection in which his father had brought him up had given him originally great humility of manner but it was now a good deal counteracted by the self conceit of a weak head living in retirement and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity a fortunate chance had recommended him to lady catherine de bourgh when the living of hunsford was vacant and the respect which he felt for her high rank and his veneration for her as his patroness mingling with a very good opinion of himself of his authority as a clergyman and his right as a rector made him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness self importance and humility having now a good house and a very sufficient income he intended to marry and in seeking a reconciliation with the longbourn family he had a wife in view as he meant to choose one of the daughters if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report this was his plan of amends of atonement for inheriting their father s estate and he thought it an excellent one full of eligibility and suitableness and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part his plan did not vary on seeing them miss bennet s lovely face confirmed his views and established all his strictest notions of what was due to seniority and for the first evening she was his settled choice the next morning however made an alteration for in a quarter of an hour s t te t te with mrs bennet before breakfast a conversation beginning with his parsonage house and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes that a mistress for it might be found at longbourn produced from her amid very complaisant smiles and general encouragement a caution against the very jane he had fixed on as to her younger daughters she could not take upon her to say she could not positively answer but she did not know of any prepossession her eldest daughter she must just mention she felt it incumbent on her to hint was likely to be very soon engaged mr collins had only to change from jane to elizabeth and it was soon done done while mrs bennet was stirring the fire elizabeth equally next to jane in birth and beauty succeeded her of course mrs bennet treasured up the hint and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before was now high in her good graces lydia s intention of walking to meryton was not forgotten every sister except mary agreed to go with her and mr collins was to attend them at the request of mr bennet who was most anxious to get rid of him and have his library to himself for thither mr collins had followed him after breakfast and there he would continue nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection but really talking to mr bennet with little cessation of his house and garden at hunsford such doings discomposed mr bennet exceedingly in his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity and though prepared as he told elizabeth to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the house he was used to be free from them there his civility therefore was most prompt in inviting mr collins to join his daughters in their walk and mr collins being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader was extremely well pleased to close his large book and go in pompous nothings on his side and civil assents on that of his cousins their time passed till they entered meryton the attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him their eyes were immediately wandering up the street in quest of the officers and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed or a really new muslin in a shop window could recall them but the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man whom they had never seen before of most gentlemanlike appearance walking with an officer on the other side of the way the officer was the very mr denny concerning whose return from london lydia came to inquire and he bowed as they passed all were struck with the stranger s air all wondered who he could be and kitty and lydia determined if possible to find out led the way across the street under pretence of wanting something in an opposite shop and fortunately had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same spot mr denny addressed them directly and entreated permission to introduce his friend mr wickham who had returned with him the day before from town and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in their corps this was exactly as it should be for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming his appearance was greatly in his favour he had all the best parts of beauty a fine countenance a good figure and very pleasing address the introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably when the sound of horses drew their notice and darcy and bingley were seen riding down the street on distinguishing the ladies of the group the two gentlemen came directly towards them and began the usual civilities bingley was the principal spokesman and miss bennet the principal object he was then he said on his way to longbourn on purpose to inquire after her mr darcy corroborated it with a bow and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on elizabeth when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger and elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting both changed colour one looked white the other red mr wickham after a few moments touched his hat a salutation which mr darcy just deigned to return what could be the meaning of it it was impossible to imagine it was impossible not to long to know in another minute mr bingley but without seeming to have noticed what passed took leave and rode on with his friend mr denny and mr wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of mr philips s house and then made their bows in spite of miss lydia s pressing entreaties that they would come in and even in spite of mrs philips s throwing up the parlour window and loudly seconding the invitation mrs philips was always glad to see her nieces and the two eldest from their recent absence were particularly welcome and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home which as their own carriage had not fetched them she should have known nothing about if she had not happened to see mr jones s shopboy in the street who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to netherfield because the miss bennets were come away when her civility was claimed towards mr collins by jane s introduction of him she received him with her very best politeness which he returned with as much more apologizing for his intrusion without any previous acquaintance with her which he could not help flattering himself however might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice mrs philips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to by exclamations and inquiries about the other of whom however she could only tell her nieces what they already knew that mr denny had brought him from london and that he was to have a lieutenant s commission in the shire she had been watching him the last hour she said as he walked up and down the street and had mr wickham appeared kitty and lydia would certainly have continued the occupation but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the officers who in comparison with the stranger were become stupid disagreeable fellows some of them were to dine with the philipses the next day and their aunt promised to make her husband call on mr wickham and give him an invitation also if the family from longbourn would come in the evening this was agreed to and mrs philips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets and a little bit of hot supper afterwards the prospect of such delights was very cheering and they parted in mutual good spirits mr collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room and was assured with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless as they walked home elizabeth related to jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen but though jane would have defended either or both had they appeared to be wrong she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister mr collins on his return highly gratified mrs bennet by admiring mrs philips s manners and politeness he protested that except lady catherine and her daughter he had never seen a more elegant woman for she had not only received him with the utmost civility but had even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening although utterly unknown to her before something he supposed might be attributed to his connection with them but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life illustration chapter xvi illustration as no objection was made to the young people s engagement with their aunt and all mr collins s scruples of leaving mr and mrs bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to meryton and the girls had the pleasure of hearing as they entered the drawing room that mr wickham had accepted their uncle s invitation and was then in the house when this information was given and they had all taken their seats mr collins was at leisure to look around him and admire and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at rosings a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification but when mrs philips understood from him what rosings was and who was its proprietor when she had listened to the description of only one of lady catherine s drawing rooms and found that the chimney piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds she felt all the force of the compliment and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeeper s room in describing to her all the grandeur of lady catherine and her mansion with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode and the improvements it was receiving he was happily employed until the gentlemen joined them and he found in mrs philips a very attentive listener whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could to the girls who could not listen to their cousin and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument and examine their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantel piece the interval of waiting appeared very long it was over at last however the gentlemen did approach and when mr wickham walked into the room elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before nor thinking of him since with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration the officers of the shire were in general a very creditable gentlemanlike set and the best of them were of the present party but mr wickham was as far beyond them all in person countenance air and walk as they were superior to the broad faced stuffy uncle philips breathing port wine who followed them into the room illustration the officers of the shire copyright by george allen mr wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned and elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation though it was only on its being a wet night and on the probability of a rainy season made her feel that the commonest dullest most threadbare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker with such rivals for the notice of the fair as mr wickham and the officers mr collins seemed to sink into insignificance to the young ladies he certainly was nothing but he had still at intervals a kind listener in mrs philips and was by her watchfulness most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin when the card tables were placed he had an opportunity of obliging her in return by sitting down to whist i know little of the game at present said he but i shall be glad to improve myself for in my situation of life mrs philips was very thankful for his compliance but could not wait for his reason mr wickham did not play at whist and with ready delight was he received at the other table between elizabeth and lydia at first there seemed danger of lydia s engrossing him entirely for she was a most determined talker but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets she soon grew too much interested in the game too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes to have attention for anyone in particular allowing for the common demands of the game mr wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to elizabeth and she was very willing to hear him though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told the history of his acquaintance with mr darcy she dared not even mention that gentleman her curiosity however was unexpectedly relieved mr wickham began the subject himself he inquired how far netherfield was from meryton and after receiving her answer asked in a hesitating manner how long mr darcy had been staying there about a month said elizabeth and then unwilling to let the subject drop added he is a man of very large property in derbyshire i understand yes replied wickham his estate there is a noble one a clear ten thousand per annum you could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself for i have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy elizabeth could not but look surprised you may well be surprised miss bennet at such an assertion after seeing as you probably might the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday are you much acquainted with mr darcy as much as i ever wish to be cried elizabeth warmly i have spent four days in the same house with him and i think him very disagreeable i have no right to give my opinion said wickham as to his being agreeable or otherwise i am not qualified to form one i have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge it is impossible for me to be impartial but i believe your opinion of him would in general astonish and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else here you are in your own family upon my word i say no more here than i might say in any house in the neighbourhood except netherfield he is not at all liked in hertfordshire everybody is disgusted with his pride you will not find him more favourably spoken of by anyone i cannot pretend to be sorry said wickham after a short interruption that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts but with him i believe it does not often happen the world is blinded by his fortune and consequence or frightened by his high and imposing manners and sees him only as he chooses to be seen i should take him even on my slight acquaintance to be an ill tempered man wickham only shook his head i wonder said he at the next opportunity of speaking whether he is likely to be in this country much longer i do not at all know but i heard nothing of his going away when i was at netherfield i hope your plans in favour of the shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood oh no it is not for me to be driven away by mr darcy if he wishes to avoid seeing me he must go we are not on friendly terms and it always gives me pain to meet him but i have no reason for avoiding him but what i might proclaim to all the world a sense of very great ill usage and most painful regrets at his being what he is his father miss bennet the late mr darcy was one of the best men that ever breathed and the truest friend i ever had and i can never be in company with this mr darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections his behaviour to myself has been scandalous but i verily believe i could forgive him anything and everything rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase and listened with all her heart but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry mr wickham began to speak on more general topics meryton the neighbourhood the society appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen and speaking of the latter especially with gentle but very intelligible gallantry it was the prospect of constant society and good society he added which was my chief inducement to enter the shire i know it to be a most respectable agreeable corps and my friend denny tempted me further by his account of their present quarters and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintance meryton had procured them society i own is necessary to me i have been a disappointed man and my spirits will not bear solitude i must have employment and society a military life is not what i was intended for but circumstances have now made it eligible the church ought to have been my profession i was brought up for the church and i should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now indeed yes the late mr darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift he was my godfather and excessively attached to me i cannot do justice to his kindness he meant to provide for me amply and thought he had done it but when the living fell it was given elsewhere good heavens cried elizabeth but how could that be how could his will be disregarded why did not you seek legal redress there was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law a man of honour could not have doubted the intention but mr darcy chose to doubt it or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation and to assert that i had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance imprudence in short anything or nothing certain it is that the living became vacant two years ago exactly as i was of an age to hold it and that it was given to another man and no less certain is it that i cannot accuse myself of having really done anything to deserve to lose it i have a warm unguarded temper and i may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion of him and to him too freely i can recall nothing worse but the fact is that we are very different sort of men and that he hates me this is quite shocking he deserves to be publicly disgraced some time or other he will be but it shall not be by me till i can forget his father i can never defy or expose him elizabeth honoured him for such feelings and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them but what said she after a pause can have been his motive what can have induced him to behave so cruelly a thorough determined dislike of me a dislike which i cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy had the late mr darcy liked me less his son might have borne with me better but his father s uncommon attachment to me irritated him i believe very early in life he had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood the sort of preference which was often given me i had not thought mr darcy so bad as this though i have never liked him i had not thought so very ill of him i had supposed him to be despising his fellow creatures in general but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge such injustice such inhumanity as this after a few minutes reflection however she continued i do remember his boasting one day at netherfield of the implacability of his resentments of his having an unforgiving temper his disposition must be dreadful i will not trust myself on the subject replied wickham i can hardly be just to him elizabeth was again deep in thought and after a time exclaimed to treat in such a manner the godson the friend the favourite of his father she could have added a young man too like you whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable but she contented herself with and one too who had probably been his own companion from childhood connected together as i think you said in the closest manner we were born in the same parish within the same park the greatest part of our youth was passed together inmates of the same house sharing the same amusements objects of the same parental care my father began life in the profession which your uncle mr philips appears to do so much credit to but he gave up everything to be of use to the late mr darcy and devoted all his time to the care of the pemberley property he was most highly esteemed by mr darcy a most intimate confidential friend mr darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father s active superintendence and when immediately before my father s death mr darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me i am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to him as of affection to myself how strange cried elizabeth how abominable i wonder that the very pride of this mr darcy has not made him just to you if from no better motive that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest for dishonesty i must call it it is wonderful replied wickham for almost all his actions may be traced to pride and pride has often been his best friend it has connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling but we are none of us consistent and in his behaviour to me there were stronger impulses even than pride can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good yes it has often led him to be liberal and generous to give his money freely to display hospitality to assist his tenants and relieve the poor family pride and filial pride for he is very proud of what his father was have done this not to appear to disgrace his family to degenerate from the popular qualities or lose the influence of the pemberley house is a powerful motive he has also brotherly pride which with some brotherly affection makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers what sort of a girl is miss darcy he shook his head i wish i could call her amiable it gives me pain to speak ill of a darcy but she is too much like her brother very very proud as a child she was affectionate and pleasing and extremely fond of me and i have devoted hours and hours to her amusement but she is nothing to me now she is a handsome girl about fifteen or sixteen and i understand highly accomplished since her father s death her home has been london where a lady lives with her and superintends her education after many pauses and many trials of other subjects elizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first and saying i am astonished at his intimacy with mr bingley how can mr bingley who seems good humour itself and is i really believe truly amiable be in friendship with such a man how can they suit each other do you know mr bingley not at all he is a sweet tempered amiable charming man he cannot know what mr darcy is probably not but mr darcy can please where he chooses he does not want abilities he can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while among those who are at all his equals in consequence he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous his pride never deserts him but with the rich he is liberal minded just sincere rational honourable and perhaps agreeable allowing something for fortune and figure the whist party soon afterwards breaking up the players gathered round the other table and mr collins took his station between his cousin elizabeth and mrs philips the usual inquiries as to his success were made by the latter it had not been very great he had lost every point but when mrs philips began to express her concern thereupon he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance that he considered the money as a mere trifle and begged she would not make herself uneasy i know very well madam said he that when persons sit down to a card table they must take their chance of these things and happily i am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object there are undoubtedly many who could not say the same but thanks to lady catherine de bourgh i am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters mr wickham s attention was caught and after observing mr collins for a few moments he asked elizabeth in a low voice whether her relations were very intimately acquainted with the family of de bourgh lady catherine de bourgh she replied has very lately given him a living i hardly know how mr collins was first introduced to her notice but he certainly has not known her long you know of course that lady catherine de bourgh and lady anne darcy were sisters consequently that she is aunt to the present mr darcy no indeed i did not i knew nothing at all of lady catherine s connections i never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday her daughter miss de bourgh will have a very large fortune and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates this information made elizabeth smile as she thought of poor miss bingley vain indeed must be all her attentions vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself if he were already self destined to another mr collins said she speaks highly both of lady catherine and her daughter but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship i suspect his gratitude misleads him and that in spite of her being his patroness she is an arrogant conceited woman i believe her to be both in a great degree replied wickham i have not seen her for many years but i very well remember that i never liked her and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent she has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever but i rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune part from her authoritative manner and the rest from the pride of her nephew who chooses that everyone connected with him should have an understanding of the first class elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards and gave the rest of the ladies their share of mr wickham s attentions there could be no conversation in the noise of mrs philips s supper party but his manners recommended him to everybody whatever he said was said well and whatever he did done gracefully elizabeth went away with her head full of him she could think of nothing but of mr wickham and of what he had told her all the way home but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went for neither lydia nor mr collins were once silent lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won and mr collins in describing the civility of mr and mrs philips protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist enumerating all the dishes at supper and repeatedly fearing that he crowded his cousins had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at longbourn house illustration delighted to see their dear friend again chapter xvii illustration elizabeth related to jane the next day what had passed between mr wickham and herself jane listened with astonishment and concern she knew not how to believe that mr darcy could be so unworthy of mr bingley s regard and yet it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as wickham the possibility of his having really endured such unkindness was enough to interest all her tender feelings and nothing therefore remained to be done but to think well of them both to defend the conduct of each and throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not be otherwise explained they have both said she been deceived i dare say in some way or other of which we can form no idea interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other it is in short impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them without actual blame on either side very true indeed and now my dear jane what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business do clear them too or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody laugh as much as you choose but you will not laugh me out of my opinion my dearest lizzy do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places mr darcy to be treating his father s favourite in such a manner one whom his father had promised to provide for it is impossible no man of common humanity no man who had any value for his character could be capable of it can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him oh no i can much more easily believe mr bingley s being imposed on than that mr wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night names facts everything mentioned without ceremony if it be not so let mr darcy contradict it besides there was truth in his looks it is difficult indeed it is distressing one does not know what to think i beg your pardon one knows exactly what to think but jane could think with certainty on only one point that mr bingley if he had been imposed on would have much to suffer when the affair became public the two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this conversation passed by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom they had been speaking mr bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long expected ball at netherfield which was fixed for the following tuesday the two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again called it an age since they had met and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation to the rest of the family they paid little attention avoiding mrs bennet as much as possible saying not much to elizabeth and nothing at all to the others they were soon gone again rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise and hurrying off as if eager to escape from mrs bennet s civilities the prospect of the netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family mrs bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from mr bingley himself instead of a ceremonious card jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends and the attentions of their brother and elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with mr wickham and of seeing a confirmation of everything in mr darcy s look and behaviour the happiness anticipated by catherine and lydia depended less on any single event or any particular person for though they each like elizabeth meant to dance half the evening with mr wickham he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them and a ball was at any rate a ball and even mary could assure her family that she had no disinclination for it while i can have my mornings to myself said she it is enough i think it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements society has claims on us all and i profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for everybody elizabeth s spirits were so high on the occasion that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to mr collins she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept mr bingley s invitation and if he did whether he would think it proper to join in the evening s amusement and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the archbishop or lady catherine de bourgh by venturing to dance i am by no means of opinion i assure you said he that a ball of this kind given by a young man of character to respectable people can have any evil tendency and i am so far from objecting to dancing myself that i shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening and i take this opportunity of soliciting yours miss elizabeth for the two first dances especially a preference which i trust my cousin jane will attribute to the right cause and not to any disrespect for her elizabeth felt herself completely taken in she had fully proposed being engaged by wickham for those very dances and to have mr collins instead her liveliness had been never worse timed there was no help for it however mr wickham s happiness and her own was perforce delayed a little longer and mr collins s proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could she was not the better pleased with his gallantry from the idea it suggested of something more it now first struck her that she was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being the mistress of hunsford parsonage and of assisting to form a quadrille table at rosings in the absence of more eligible visitors the idea soon reached to conviction as she observed his increasing civilities towards herself and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity and though more astonished than gratified herself by this effect of her charms it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to her elizabeth however did not choose to take the hint being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply mr collins might never make the offer and till he did it was useless to quarrel about him if there had not been a netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of the younger miss bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time for from the day of the invitation to the day of the ball there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to meryton once no aunt no officers no news could be sought after the very shoe roses for netherfield were got by proxy even elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with mr wickham and nothing less than a dance on tuesday could have made such a friday saturday sunday and monday endurable to kitty and lydia illustration chapter xviii illustration till elizabeth entered the drawing room at netherfield and looked in vain for mr wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her the certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her she had dressed with more than usual care and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening but in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for mr darcy s pleasure in the bingleys invitation to the officers and though this was not exactly the case the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend mr denny to whom lydia eagerly applied and who told them that wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before and was not yet returned adding with a significant smile i do not imagine his business would have called him away just now if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here this part of his intelligence though unheard by lydia was caught by elizabeth and as it assured her that darcy was not less answerable for wickham s absence than if her first surmise had been just every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make attention forbearance patience with darcy was injury to wickham she was resolved against any sort of conversation with him and turned away with a degree of ill humour which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to mr bingley whose blind partiality provoked her but elizabeth was not formed for ill humour and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening it could not dwell long on her spirits and having told all her griefs to charlotte lucas whom she had not seen for a week she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin and to point him out to her particular notice the two first dances however brought a return of distress they were dances of mortification mr collins awkward and solemn apologizing instead of attending and often moving wrong without being aware of it gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give the moment of her release from him was ecstasy she danced next with an officer and had the refreshment of talking of wickham and of hearing that he was universally liked when those dances were over she returned to charlotte lucas and was in conversation with her when she found herself suddenly addressed by mr darcy who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand that without knowing what she did she accepted him he walked away again immediately and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind charlotte tried to console her i dare say you will find him very agreeable heaven forbid that would be the greatest misfortune of all to find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate do not wish me such an evil when the dancing recommenced however and darcy approached to claim her hand charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a simpleton and allow her fancy for wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man often times his consequence elizabeth made no answer and took her place in the set amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to mr darcy and reading in her neighbours looks their equal amazement in beholding it they stood for some time without speaking a word and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances and at first was resolved not to break it till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk she made some slight observation on the dance he replied and was again silent after a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with it is your turn to say something now mr darcy i talked about the dance and you ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room or the number of couples he smiled and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said very well that reply will do for the present perhaps by and by i may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones but now we may be silent do you talk by rule then while you are dancing sometimes one must speak a little you know it would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together and yet for the advantage of some conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible are you consulting your own feelings in the present case or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine both replied elizabeth archly for i have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds we are each of an unsocial taciturn disposition unwilling to speak unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room and be handed down to posterity with all the clat of a proverb this is no very striking resemblance of your own character i am sure said he how near it may be to mine i cannot pretend to say you think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly i must not decide on my own performance he made no answer and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to meryton she answered in the affirmative and unable to resist the temptation added when you met us there the other day we had just been forming a new acquaintance the effect was immediate a deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features but he said not a word and elizabeth though blaming herself for her own weakness could not go on at length darcy spoke and in a constrained manner said mr wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may insure his making friends whether he may be equally capable of retaining them is less certain he has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship replied elizabeth with emphasis and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life darcy made no answer and seemed desirous of changing the subject at that moment sir william lucas appeared close to them meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room but on perceiving mr darcy he stopped with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner i have been most highly gratified indeed my dear sir such very superior dancing is not often seen it is evident that you belong to the first circles allow me to say however that your fair partner does not disgrace you and that i must hope to have this pleasure often repeated especially when a certain desirable event my dear miss eliza glancing at her sister and bingley shall take place what congratulations will then flow in i appeal to mr darcy but let me not interrupt you sir you will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me illustration such very superior dancing is not often seen copyright by george allen the latter part of this address was scarcely heard by darcy but sir william s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards bingley and jane who were dancing together recovering himself however shortly he turned to his partner and said sir william s interruption has made me forget what we were talking of i do not think we were speaking at all sir william could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves we have tried two or three subjects already without success and what we are to talk of next i cannot imagine what think you of books said he smiling books oh no i am sure we never read the same or not with the same feelings i am sorry you think so but if that be the case there can at least be no want of subject we may compare our different opinions no i cannot talk of books in a ball room my head is always full of something else the present always occupies you in such scenes does it said he with a look of doubt yes always she replied without knowing what she said for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming i remember hearing you once say mr darcy that you hardly ever forgave that your resentment once created was unappeasable you are very cautious i suppose as to its being created i am said he with a firm voice and never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice i hope not it is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion to be secure of judging properly at first may i ask to what these questions tend merely to the illustration of your character said she endeavouring to shake off her gravity i am trying to make it out and what is your success she shook her head i do not get on at all i hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly i can readily believe answered he gravely that reports may vary greatly with respect to me and i could wish miss bennet that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either but if i do not take your likeness now i may never have another opportunity i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours he coldly replied she said no more and they went down the other dance and parted in silence on each side dissatisfied though not to an equal degree for in darcy s breast there was a tolerably powerful feeling towards her which soon procured her pardon and directed all his anger against another they had not long separated when miss bingley came towards her and with an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her so miss eliza i hear you are quite delighted with george wickham your sister has been talking to me about him and asking me a thousand questions and i find that the young man forgot to tell you among his other communications that he was the son of old wickham the late mr darcy s steward let me recommend you however as a friend not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions for as to mr darcy s using him ill it is perfectly false for on the contrary he has been always remarkably kind to him though george wickham has treated mr darcy in a most infamous manner i do not know the particulars but i know very well that mr darcy is not in the least to blame that he cannot bear to hear george wickham mentioned and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way his coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing indeed and i wonder how he could presume to do it i pity you miss eliza for this discovery of your favourite s guilt but really considering his descent one could not expect much better his guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same said elizabeth angrily for i have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of mr darcy s steward and of that i can assure you he informed me himself i beg your pardon replied miss bingley turning away with a sneer excuse my interference it was kindly meant insolent girl said elizabeth to herself you are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this i see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of mr darcy she then sought her eldest sister who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of bingley jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency a glow of such happy expression as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening elizabeth instantly read her feelings and at that moment solicitude for wickham resentment against his enemies and everything else gave way before the hope of jane s being in the fairest way for happiness i want to know said she with a countenance no less smiling than her sister s what you have learnt about mr wickham but perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person in which case you may be sure of my pardon no replied jane i have not forgotten him but i have nothing satisfactory to tell you mr bingley does not know the whole of his history and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended mr darcy but he will vouch for the good conduct the probity and honour of his friend and is perfectly convinced that mr wickham has deserved much less attention from mr darcy than he has received and i am sorry to say that by his account as well as his sister s mr wickham is by no means a respectable young man i am afraid he has been very imprudent and has deserved to lose mr darcy s regard mr bingley does not know mr wickham himself no he never saw him till the other morning at meryton this account then is what he has received from mr darcy i am perfectly satisfied but what does he say of the living he does not exactly recollect the circumstances though he has heard them from mr darcy more than once but he believes that it was left to him conditionally only i have not a doubt of mr bingley s sincerity said elizabeth warmly but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only mr bingley s defence of his friend was a very able one i dare say but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story and has learnt the rest from that friend himself i shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as i did before she then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each and on which there could be no difference of sentiment elizabeth listened with delight to the happy though modest hopes which jane entertained of bingley s regard and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it on their being joined by mr bingley himself elizabeth withdrew to miss lucas to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied before mr collins came up to them and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery i have found out said he by a singular accident that there is now in the room a near relation to my patroness i happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin miss de bourgh and of her mother lady catherine how wonderfully these sort of things occur who would have thought of my meeting with perhaps a nephew of lady catherine de bourgh in this assembly i am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him which i am now going to do and trust he will excuse my not having done it before my total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology you are not going to introduce yourself to mr darcy indeed i am i shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier i believe him to be lady catherine s nephew it will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se nnight elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme assuring him that mr darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom rather than a compliment to his aunt that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side and that if it were it must belong to mr darcy the superior in consequence to begin the acquaintance mr collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination and when she ceased speaking replied thus my dear miss elizabeth i have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your understanding but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity and those which regulate the clergy for give me leave to observe that i consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained you must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion which lead me to perform what i look on as a point of duty pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice which on every other subject shall be my constant guide though in the case before us i consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself and with a low bow he left her to attack mr darcy whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow and though she could not hear a word of it she felt as if hearing it all and saw in the motion of his lips the words apology hunsford and lady catherine de bourgh it vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man mr darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder and when at last mr collins allowed him to speak replied with an air of distant civility mr collins however was not discouraged from speaking again and mr darcy s contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow and moved another way mr collins then returned to elizabeth i have no reason i assure you said he to be dissatisfied with my reception mr darcy seemed much pleased with the attention he answered me with the utmost civility and even paid me the compliment of saying that he was so well convinced of lady catherine s discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily it was really a very handsome thought upon the whole i am much pleased with him as elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and mr bingley and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to made her perhaps almost as happy as jane she saw her in idea settled in that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow and she felt capable under such circumstances of endeavouring even to like bingley s two sisters her mother s thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way and she determined not to venture near her lest she might hear too much when they sat down to supper therefore she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person lady lucas freely openly and of nothing else but of her expectation that jane would be soon married to mr bingley it was an animating subject and mrs bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match his being such a charming young man and so rich and living but three miles from them were the first points of self gratulation and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of jane and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do it was moreover such a promising thing for her younger daughters as jane s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men and lastly it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked it was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure because on such occasions it is the etiquette but no one was less likely than mrs bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life she concluded with many good wishes that lady lucas might soon be equally fortunate though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother s words or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper for to her inexpressible vexation she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by mr darcy who sat opposite to them her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical what is mr darcy to me pray that i should be afraid of him i am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing he may not like to hear for heaven s sake madam speak lower what advantage can it be to you to offend mr darcy you will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing nothing that she could say however had any influence her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation she could not help frequently glancing her eye at mr darcy though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded for though he was not always looking at her mother she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her the expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity at length however mrs bennet had no more to say and lady lucas who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken elizabeth now began to revive but not long was the interval of tranquillity for when supper was over singing was talked of and she had the mortification of seeing mary after very little entreaty preparing to oblige the company by many significant looks and silent entreaties did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance but in vain mary would not understand them such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her and she began her song elizabeth s eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close for mary on receiving amongst the thanks of the table the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again after the pause of half a minute began another mary s powers were by no means fitted for such a display her voice was weak and her manner affected elizabeth was in agonies she looked at jane to see how she bore it but jane was very composedly talking to bingley she looked at his two sisters and saw them making signs of derision at each other and at darcy who continued however impenetrably grave she looked at her father to entreat his interference lest mary should be singing all night he took the hint and when mary had finished her second song said aloud that will do extremely well child you have delighted us long enough let the other young ladies have time to exhibit mary though pretending not to hear was somewhat disconcerted and elizabeth sorry for her and sorry for her father s speech was afraid her anxiety had done no good others of the party were now applied to if i said mr collins were so fortunate as to be able to sing i should have great pleasure i am sure in obliging the company with an air for i consider music as a very innocent diversion and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman i do not mean however to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music for there are certainly other things to be attended to the rector of a parish has much to do in the first place he must make such an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron he must write his own sermons and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties and the care and improvement of his dwelling which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible and i do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards everybody especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment i cannot acquit him of that duty nor could i think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards anybody connected with the family and with a bow to mr darcy he concluded his speech which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room many stared many smiled but no one looked more amused than mr bennet himself while his wife seriously commended mr collins for having spoken so sensibly and observed in a half whisper to lady lucas that he was a remarkably clever good kind of young man to elizabeth it appeared that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit or finer success and happy did she think it for bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed that his two sisters and mr darcy however should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman or the insolent smiles of the ladies were more intolerable the rest of the evening brought her little amusement she was teased by mr collins who continued most perseveringly by her side and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again put it out of her power to dance with others in vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else and offered to introduce him to any young lady in the room he assured her that as to dancing he was perfectly indifferent to it that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening there was no arguing upon such a project she owed her greatest relief to her friend miss lucas who often joined them and good naturedly engaged mr collins s conversation to herself she was at least free from the offence of mr darcy s further notice though often standing within a very short distance of her quite disengaged he never came near enough to speak she felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to mr wickham and rejoiced in it the longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart and by a man uvre of mrs bennet had to wait for their carriage a quarter of an hour after everybody else was gone which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family mrs hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves they repulsed every attempt of mrs bennet at conversation and by so doing threw a languor over the whole party which was very little relieved by the long speeches of mr collins who was complimenting mr bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests darcy said nothing at all mr bennet in equal silence was enjoying the scene mr bingley and jane were standing together a little detached from the rest and talked only to each other elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either mrs hurst or miss bingley and even lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of lord how tired i am accompanied by a violent yawn when at length they arose to take leave mrs bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at longbourn and addressed herself particularly to mr bingley to assure him how happy he would make them by eating a family dinner with them at any time without the ceremony of a formal invitation bingley was all grateful pleasure and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her after his return from london whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time mrs bennet was perfectly satisfied and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements new carriages and wedding clothes she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at netherfield in the course of three or four months of having another daughter married to mr collins she thought with equal certainty and with considerable though not equal pleasure elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children and though the man and the match were quite good enough for her the worth of each was eclipsed by mr bingley and netherfield illustration to assure you in the most animated language chapter xix illustration the next day opened a new scene at longbourn mr collins made his declaration in form having resolved to do it without loss of time as his leave of absence extended only to the following saturday and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment he set about it in a very orderly manner with all the observances which he supposed a regular part of the business on finding mrs bennet elizabeth and one of the younger girls together soon after breakfast he addressed the mother in these words may i hope madam for your interest with your fair daughter elizabeth when i solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning before elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise mrs bennet instantly answered oh dear yes certainly i am sure lizzy will be very happy i am sure she can have no objection come kitty i want you upstairs and gathering her work together she was hastening away when elizabeth called out dear ma am do not go i beg you will not go mr collins must excuse me he can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not hear i am going away myself no no nonsense lizzy i desire you will stay where you are and upon elizabeth s seeming really with vexed and embarrassed looks about to escape she added lizzy i insist upon your staying and hearing mr collins elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction and a moment s consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible she sat down again and tried to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion mrs bennet and kitty walked off and as soon as they were gone mr collins began believe me my dear miss elizabeth that your modesty so far from doing you any disservice rather adds to your other perfections you would have been less amiable in my eyes had there not been this little unwillingness but allow me to assure you that i have your respected mother s permission for this address you can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken almost as soon as i entered the house i singled you out as the companion of my future life but before i am run away with by my feelings on this subject perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying and moreover for coming into hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife as i certainly did the idea of mr collins with all his solemn composure being run away with by his feelings made elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther and he continued my reasons for marrying are first that i think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances like myself to set the example of matrimony in his parish secondly that i am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness and thirdly which perhaps i ought to have mentioned earlier that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom i have the honour of calling patroness twice has she condescended to give me her opinion unasked too on this subject and it was but the very saturday night before i left hunsford between our pools at quadrille while mrs jenkinson was arranging miss de bourgh s footstool that she said mr collins you must marry a clergyman like you must marry choose properly choose a gentlewoman for my sake and for your own let her be an active useful sort of person not brought up high but able to make a small income go a good way this is my advice find such a woman as soon as you can bring her to hunsford and i will visit her allow me by the way to observe my fair cousin that i do not reckon the notice and kindness of lady catherine de bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer you will find her manners beyond anything i can describe and your wit and vivacity i think must be acceptable to her especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony it remains to be told why my views were directed to longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood where i assure you there are many amiable young women but the fact is that being as i am to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father who however may live many years longer i could not satisfy myself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters that the loss to them might be as little as possible when the melancholy event takes place which however as i have already said may not be for several years this has been my motive my fair cousin and i flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem and now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection to fortune i am perfectly indifferent and shall make no demand of that nature on your father since i am well aware that it could not be complied with and that one thousand pounds in the per cents which will not be yours till after your mother s decease is all that you may ever be entitled to on that head therefore i shall be uniformly silent and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married it was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now you are too hasty sir she cried you forget that i have made no answer let me do it without further loss of time accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me i am very sensible of the honour of your proposals but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline them i am not now to learn replied mr collins with a formal wave of the hand that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept when he first applies for their favour and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time i am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long upon my word sir cried elizabeth your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration i do assure you that i am not one of those young ladies if such young ladies there are who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time i am perfectly serious in my refusal you could not make me happy and i am convinced that i am the last woman in the world who would make you so nay were your friend lady catherine to know me i am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation were it certain that lady catherine would think so said mr collins very gravely but i cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you and you may be certain that when i have the honour of seeing her again i shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty economy and other amiable qualifications indeed mr collins all praise of me will be unnecessary you must give me leave to judge for myself and pay me the compliment of believing what i say i wish you very happy and very rich and by refusing your hand do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise in making me the offer you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family and may take possession of longbourn estate whenever it falls without any self reproach this matter may be considered therefore as finally settled and rising as she thus spoke she would have quitted the room had not mr collins thus addressed her when i do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject i shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me though i am far from accusing you of cruelty at present because i know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character really mr collins cried elizabeth with some warmth you puzzle me exceedingly if what i have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement i know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one you must give me leave to flatter myself my dear cousin that your refusal of my addresses are merely words of course my reasons for believing it are briefly these it does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy of your acceptance or that the establishment i can offer would be any other than highly desirable my situation in life my connections with the family of de bourgh and my relationship to your own are circumstances highly in my favour and you should take it into further consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications as i must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me i shall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense according to the usual practice of elegant females i do assure you sir that i have no pretensions whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man i would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere i thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals but to accept them is absolutely impossible my feelings in every respect forbid it can i speak plainer do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart you are uniformly charming cried he with an air of awkward gallantry and i am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents my proposals will not fail of being acceptable to such perseverance in wilful self deception elizabeth would make no reply and immediately and in silence withdrew determined that if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement to apply to her father whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female illustration chapter xx illustration mr collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love for mrs bennet having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference no sooner saw elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase than she entered the breakfast room and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection mr collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character this information however startled mrs bennet she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals but she dared not believe it and could not help saying so but depend upon it mr collins she added that lizzy shall be brought to reason i will speak to her about it myself directly she is a very headstrong foolish girl and does not know her own interest but i will make her know it pardon me for interrupting you madam cried mr collins but if she is really headstrong and foolish i know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state if therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me because if liable to such defects of temper she could not contribute much to my felicity sir you quite misunderstand me said mrs bennet alarmed lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these in everything else she is as good natured a girl as ever lived i will go directly to mr bennet and we shall very soon settle it with her i am sure she would not give him time to reply but hurrying instantly to her husband called out as she entered the library oh mr bennet you are wanted immediately we are all in an uproar you must come and make lizzy marry mr collins for she vows she will not have him and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have her mr bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication i have not the pleasure of understanding you said he when she had finished her speech of what are you talking of mr collins and lizzy lizzy declares she will not have mr collins and mr collins begins to say that he will not have lizzy and what am i to do on the occasion it seems a hopeless business speak to lizzy about it yourself tell her that you insist upon her marrying him let her be called down she shall hear my opinion mrs bennet rang the bell and miss elizabeth was summoned to the library come here child cried her father as she appeared i have sent for you on an affair of importance i understand that mr collins has made you an offer of marriage is it true elizabeth replied that it was very well and this offer of marriage you have refused i have sir very well we now come to the point your mother insists upon your accepting it is it not so mrs bennet yes or i will never see her again an unhappy alternative is before you elizabeth from this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents your mother will never see you again if you do not marry mr collins and i will never see you again if you do elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning but mrs bennet who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished was excessively disappointed what do you mean mr bennet by talking in this way you promised me to insist upon her marrying him my dear replied her husband i have two small favours to request first that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion and secondly of my room i shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be not yet however in spite of her disappointment in her husband did mrs bennet give up the point she talked to elizabeth again and again coaxed and threatened her by turns she endeavoured to secure jane in her interest but jane with all possible mildness declined interfering and elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks though her manner varied however her determination never did mr collins meanwhile was meditating in solitude on what had passed he thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin could refuse him and though his pride was hurt he suffered in no other way his regard for her was quite imaginary and the possibility of her deserving her mother s reproach prevented his feeling any regret while the family were in this confusion charlotte lucas came to spend the day with them she was met in the vestibule by lydia who flying to her cried in a half whisper i am glad you are come for there is such fun here what do you think has happened this morning mr collins has made an offer to lizzy and she will not have him illustration they entered the breakfast room charlotte had hardly time to answer before they were joined by kitty who came to tell the same news and no sooner had they entered the breakfast room where mrs bennet was alone than she likewise began on the subject calling on miss lucas for her compassion and entreating her to persuade her friend lizzy to comply with the wishes of her family pray do my dear miss lucas she added in a melancholy tone for nobody is on my side nobody takes part with me i am cruelly used nobody feels for my poor nerves charlotte s reply was spared by the entrance of jane and elizabeth ay there she comes continued mrs bennet looking as unconcerned as may be and caring no more for us than if we were at york provided she can have her own way but i tell you what miss lizzy if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way you will never get a husband at all and i am sure i do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead i shall not be able to keep you and so i warn you i have done with you from this very day i told you in the library you know that i should never speak to you again and you will find me as good as my word i have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children not that i have much pleasure indeed in talking to anybody people who suffer as i do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking nobody can tell what i suffer but it is always so those who do not complain are never pitied her daughters listened in silence to this effusion sensible that any attempt to reason with or soothe her would only increase the irritation she talked on therefore without interruption from any of them till they were joined by mr collins who entered with an air more stately than usual and on perceiving whom she said to the girls now i do insist upon it that you all of you hold your tongues and let mr collins and me have a little conversation together elizabeth passed quietly out of the room jane and kitty followed but lydia stood her ground determined to hear all she could and charlotte detained first by the civility of mr collins whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute and then by a little curiosity satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear in a doleful voice mrs bennet thus began the projected conversation oh mr collins my dear madam replied he let us be for ever silent on this point far be it from me he presently continued in a voice that marked his displeasure to resent the behaviour of your daughter resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as i have been in early preferment and i trust i am resigned perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand for i have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation you will not i hope consider me as showing any disrespect to your family my dear madam by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter s favour without having paid yourself and mr bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf my conduct may i fear be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughter s lips instead of your own but we are all liable to error i have certainly meant well through the whole affair my object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself with due consideration for the advantage of all your family and if my manner has been at all reprehensible i here beg leave to apologize illustration chapter xxi illustration the discussion of mr collins s offer was now nearly at an end and elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother as for the gentleman himself his feelings were chiefly expressed not by embarrassment or dejection or by trying to avoid her but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence he scarcely ever spoke to her and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself were transferred for the rest of the day to miss lucas whose civility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all and especially to her friend the morrow produced no abatement of mrs bennet s ill humour or ill health mr collins was also in the same state of angry pride elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it he was always to have gone on saturday and to saturday he still meant to stay after breakfast the girls walked to meryton to inquire if mr wickham were returned and to lament over his absence from the netherfield ball he joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their aunt s where his regret and vexation and the concern of everybody were well talked over to elizabeth however he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence had been self imposed i found said he as the time drew near that i had better not meet mr darcy that to be in the same room the same party with him for so many hours together might be more than i could bear and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself she highly approved his forbearance and they had leisure for a full discussion of it and for all the commendations which they civilly bestowed on each other as wickham and another officer walked back with them to longbourn and during the walk he particularly attended to her his accompanying them was a double advantage she felt all the compliment it offered to herself and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother illustration walked back with them copyright by george allen soon after their return a letter was delivered to miss bennet it came from netherfield and was opened immediately the envelope contained a sheet of elegant little hot pressed paper well covered with a lady s fair flowing hand and elizabeth saw her sister s countenance change as she read it and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages jane recollected herself soon and putting the letter away tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation but elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from wickham and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave than a glance from jane invited her to follow her upstairs when they had gained their own room jane taking out her letter said this is from caroline bingley what it contains has surprised me a good deal the whole party have left netherfield by this time and are on their way to town and without any intention of coming back again you shall hear what she says she then read the first sentence aloud which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly and of their meaning to dine that day in grosvenor street where mr hurst had a house the next was in these words i do not pretend to regret anything i shall leave in hertfordshire except your society my dearest friend but we will hope at some future period to enjoy many returns of that delightful intercourse we have known and in the meanwhile may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence i depend on you for that to these high flown expressions elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her she saw nothing in it really to lament it was not to be supposed that their absence from netherfield would prevent mr bingley s being there and as to the loss of their society she was persuaded that jane must soon cease to regard it in the enjoyment of his it is unlucky said she after a short pause that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country but may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which miss bingley looks forward may arrive earlier than she is aware and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters mr bingley will not be detained in london by them caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into hertfordshire this winter i will read it to you when my brother left us yesterday he imagined that the business which took him to london might be concluded in three or four days but as we are certain it cannot be so and at the same time convinced that when charles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again we have determined on following him thither that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel many of my acquaintance are already there for the winter i wish i could hear that you my dearest friend had any intention of making one in the crowd but of that i despair i sincerely hope your christmas in hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of whom we shall deprive you it is evident by this added jane that he comes back no more this winter it is only evident that miss bingley does not mean he should why will you think so it must be his own doing he is his own master but you do not know all i will read you the passage which particularly hurts me i will have no reserves from you mr darcy is impatient to see his sister and to confess the truth we are scarcely less eager to meet her again i really do not think georgiana darcy has her equal for beauty elegance and accomplishments and the affection she inspires in louisa and myself is heightened into something still more interesting from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister i do not know whether i ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject but i will not leave the country without confiding them and i trust you will not esteem them unreasonable my brother admires her greatly already he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing her relations all wish the connection as much as his own and a sister s partiality is not misleading me i think when i call charles most capable of engaging any woman s heart with all these circumstances to favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it am i wrong my dearest jane in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many what think you of this sentence my dear lizzy said jane as she finished it is it not clear enough does it not expressly declare that caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister that she is perfectly convinced of her brother s indifference and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him she means most kindly to put me on my guard can there be any other opinion on the subject yes there can for mine is totally different will you hear it most willingly you shall have it in a few words miss bingley sees that her brother is in love with you and wants him to marry miss darcy she follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you jane shook her head indeed jane you ought to believe me no one who has ever seen you together can doubt his affection miss bingley i am sure cannot she is not such a simpleton could she have seen half as much love in mr darcy for herself she would have ordered her wedding clothes but the case is this we are not rich enough or grand enough for them and she is the more anxious to get miss darcy for her brother from the notion that when there has been one inter marriage she may have less trouble in achieving a second in which there is certainly some ingenuity and i dare say it would succeed if miss de bourgh were out of the way but my dearest jane you cannot seriously imagine that because miss bingley tells you her brother greatly admires miss darcy he is in the smallest degree less sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on tuesday or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you he is very much in love with her friend if we thought alike of miss bingley replied jane your representation of all this might make me quite easy but i know the foundation is unjust caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving anyone and all that i can hope in this case is that she is deceived herself that is right you could not have started a more happy idea since you will not take comfort in mine believe her to be deceived by all means you have now done your duty by her and must fret no longer but my dear sister can i be happy even supposing the best in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere you must decide for yourself said elizabeth and if upon mature deliberation you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife i advise you by all means to refuse him how can you talk so said jane faintly smiling you must know that though i should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation i could not hesitate i did not think you would and that being the case i cannot consider your situation with much compassion but if he returns no more this winter my choice will never be required a thousand things may arise in six months the idea of his returning no more elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt it appeared to her merely the suggestion of caroline s interested wishes and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes however openly or artfully spoken could influence a young man so totally independent of everyone she represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect jane s temper was not desponding and she was gradually led to hope though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope that bingley would return to netherfield and answer every wish of her heart they agreed that mrs bennet should only hear of the departure of the family without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman s conduct but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together after lamenting it however at some length she had the consolation of thinking that mr bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at longbourn and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that though he had been invited only to a family dinner she would take care to have two full courses illustration chapter xxii illustration the bennets were engaged to dine with the lucases and again during the chief of the day was miss lucas so kind as to listen to mr collins elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her it keeps him in good humour said she and i am more obliged to you than i can express charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time this was very amiable but charlotte s kindness extended farther than elizabeth had any conception of its object was nothing less than to secure her from any return of mr collins s addresses by engaging them towards herself such was miss lucas s scheme and appearances were so favourable that when they parted at night she would have felt almost sure of success if he had not been to leave hertfordshire so very soon but here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character for it led him to escape out of longbourn house the next morning with admirable slyness and hasten to lucas lodge to throw himself at her feet he was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins from a conviction that if they saw him depart they could not fail to conjecture his design and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success could be known likewise for though feeling almost secure and with reason for charlotte had been tolerably encouraging he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of wednesday his reception however was of the most flattering kind miss lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane but little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there in as short a time as mr collins s long speeches would allow everything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both and as they entered the house he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men and though such a solicitation must be waived for the present the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness the stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance and miss lucas who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment cared not how soon that establishment were gained sir william and lady lucas were speedily applied to for their consent and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity mr collins s present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter to whom they could give little fortune and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair lady lucas began directly to calculate with more interest than the matter had ever illustration so much love and eloquence copyright by george allen excited before how many years longer mr bennet was likely to live and sir william gave it as his decided opinion that whenever mr collins should be in possession of the longbourn estate it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at st james s the whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the occasion the younger girls formed hopes of coming out a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of charlotte s dying an old maid charlotte herself was tolerably composed she had gained her point and had time to consider of it her reflections were in general satisfactory mr collins to be sure was neither sensible nor agreeable his society was irksome and his attachment to her must be imaginary but still he would be her husband without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony marriage had always been her object it was the only honourable provision for well educated young women of small fortune and however uncertain of giving happiness must be their pleasantest preservative from want this preservative she had now obtained and at the age of twenty seven without having ever been handsome she felt all the good luck of it the least agreeable circumstance in the business was the surprise it must occasion to elizabeth bennet whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person elizabeth would wonder and probably would blame her and though her resolution was not to be shaken her feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation she resolved to give her the information herself and therefore charged mr collins when he returned to longbourn to dinner to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family a promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given but it could not be kept without difficulty for the curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct questions on his return as required some ingenuity to evade and he was at the same time exercising great self denial for he was longing to publish his prosperous love as he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family the ceremony of leave taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night and mrs bennet with great politeness and cordiality said how happy they should be to see him at longbourn again whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them my dear madam he replied this invitation is particularly gratifying because it is what i have been hoping to receive and you may be very certain that i shall avail myself of it as soon as possible they were all astonished and mr bennet who could by no means wish for so speedy a return immediately said but is there not danger of lady catherine s disapprobation here my good sir you had better neglect your relations than run the risk of offending your patroness my dear sir replied mr collins i am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyship s concurrence you cannot be too much on your guard risk anything rather than her displeasure and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again which i should think exceedingly probable stay quietly at home and be satisfied that we shall take no offence believe me my dear sir my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention and depend upon it you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this as well as for every other mark of your regard during my stay in hertfordshire as for my fair cousins though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary i shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness not excepting my cousin elizabeth with proper civilities the ladies then withdrew all of them equally surprised to find that he meditated a quick return mrs bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls and mary might have been prevailed on to accept him she rated his abilities much higher than any of the others there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her and though by no means so clever as herself she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as hers he might become a very agreeable companion but on the following morning every hope of this kind was done away miss lucas called soon after breakfast and in a private conference with elizabeth related the event of the day before the possibility of mr collins s fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to elizabeth within the last day or two but that charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from possibility as that she could encourage him herself and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum and she could not help crying out engaged to mr collins my dear charlotte impossible the steady countenance which miss lucas had commanded in telling her story gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach though as it was no more than she expected she soon regained her composure and calmly replied why should you be surprised my dear eliza do you think it incredible that mr collins should be able to procure any woman s good opinion because he was not so happy as to succeed with you but elizabeth had now recollected herself and making a strong effort for it was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her and that she wished her all imaginable happiness i see what you are feeling replied charlotte you must be surprised very much surprised so lately as mr collins was wishing to marry you but when you have had time to think it all over i hope you will be satisfied with what i have done i am not romantic you know i never was i ask only a comfortable home and considering mr collins s character connections and situation in life i am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the marriage state elizabeth quietly answered undoubtedly and after an awkward pause they returned to the rest of the family charlotte did not stay much longer and elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard it was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match the strangeness of mr collins s making two offers of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted she had always felt that charlotte s opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own but she could not have supposed it possible that when called into action she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage charlotte the wife of mr collins was a most humiliating picture and to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen illustration protested he must be entirely mistaken copyright by george allen chapter xxiii illustration elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters reflecting on what she had heard and doubting whether she was authorized to mention it when sir william lucas himself appeared sent by his daughter to announce her engagement to the family with many compliments to them and much self gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses he unfolded the matter to an audience not merely wondering but incredulous for mrs bennet with more perseverance than politeness protested he must be entirely mistaken and lydia always unguarded and often uncivil boisterously exclaimed good lord sir william how can you tell such a story do not you know that mr collins wants to marry lizzy nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment but sir william s good breeding carried him through it all and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy elizabeth feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation now put herself forward to confirm his account by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from charlotte herself and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters by the earnestness of her congratulations to sir william in which she was readily joined by jane and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match the excellent character of mr collins and the convenient distance of hunsford from london mrs bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while sir william remained but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent in the first place she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter secondly she was very sure that mr collins had been taken in thirdly she trusted that they would never be happy together and fourthly that the match might be broken off two inferences however were plainly deduced from the whole one that elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief and the other that she herself had been barbarously used by them all and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day nothing could console and nothing appease her nor did that day wear out her resentment a week elapsed before she could see elizabeth without scolding her a month passed away before she could speak to sir william or lady lucas without being rude and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter mr bennet s emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort for it gratified him he said to discover that charlotte lucas whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible was as foolish as his wife and more foolish than his daughter jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness nor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable kitty and lydia were far from envying miss lucas for mr collins was only a clergyman and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at meryton lady lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on mrs bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married and she called at longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was though mrs bennet s sour looks and ill natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away between elizabeth and charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject and elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again her disappointment in charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious as bingley had now been gone a week and nothing was heard of his return jane had sent caroline an early answer to her letter and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again the promised letter of thanks from mr collins arrived on tuesday addressed to their father and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelve month s abode in the family might have prompted after discharging his conscience on that head he proceeded to inform them with many rapturous expressions of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour miss lucas and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at longbourn whither he hoped to be able to return on monday fortnight for lady catherine he added so heartily approved his marriage that she wished it to take place as soon as possible which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men mr collins s return into hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to mrs bennet on the contrary she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband it was very strange that he should come to longbourn instead of to lucas lodge it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome she hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable such were the gentle murmurs of mrs bennet and they gave way only to the greater distress of mr bingley s continued absence neither jane nor elizabeth were comfortable on this subject day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in meryton of his coming no more to netherfield the whole winter a report which highly incensed mrs bennet and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood even elizabeth began to fear not that bingley was indifferent but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive to jane s happiness and so dishonourable to the stability of her lover she could not prevent its frequently recurring the united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend assisted by the attractions of miss darcy and the amusements of london might be too much she feared for the strength of his attachment as for jane her anxiety under this suspense was of course more painful than elizabeth s but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing and between herself and elizabeth therefore the subject was never alluded to but as no such delicacy restrained her mother an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of bingley express her impatience for his arrival or even require jane to confess that if he did not come back she should think herself very ill used it needed all jane s steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity mr collins returned most punctually on the monday fortnight but his reception at longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction he was too happy however to need much attention and luckily for the others the business of love making relieved them from a great deal of his company the chief of every day was spent by him at lucas lodge and he sometimes returned to longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed illustration whenever she spoke in a low voice mrs bennet was really in a most pitiable state the very mention of anything concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill humour and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of the sight of miss lucas was odious to her as her successor in that house she regarded her with jealous abhorrence whenever charlotte came to see them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession and whenever she spoke in a low voice to mr collins was convinced that they were talking of the longbourn estate and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house as soon as mr bennet was dead she complained bitterly of all this to her husband indeed mr bennet said she it is very hard to think that charlotte lucas should ever be mistress of this house that i should be forced to make way for her and live to see her take my place in it my dear do not give way to such gloomy thoughts let us hope for better things let us flatter ourselves that i may be the survivor this was not very consoling to mrs bennet and therefore instead of making any answer she went on as before i cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate if it was not for the entail i should not mind it what should not you mind i should not mind anything at all let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility i never can be thankful mr bennet for anything about the entail how anyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one s own daughters i cannot understand and all for the sake of mr collins too why should he have it more than anybody else i leave it to yourself to determine said mr bennet illustration chapter xxiv illustration miss bingley s letter arrived and put an end to doubt the very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in london for the winter and concluded with her brother s regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in hertfordshire before he left the country hope was over entirely over and when jane could attend to the rest of the letter she found little except the professed affection of the writer that could give her any comfort miss darcy s praise occupied the chief of it her many attractions were again dwelt on and caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter she wrote also with great pleasure of her brother s being an inmate of mr darcy s house and mentioned with raptures some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture elizabeth to whom jane very soon communicated the chief of all this heard it in silent indignation her heart was divided between concern for her sister and resentment against all others to caroline s assertion of her brother s being partial to miss darcy she paid no credit that he was really fond of jane she doubted no more than she had ever done and much as she had always been disposed to like him she could not think without anger hardly without contempt on that easiness of temper that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave of his designing friends and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to the caprice of their inclinations had his own happiness however been the only sacrifice he might have been allowed to sport with it in whatever manner he thought best but her sister s was involved in it as she thought he must be sensible himself it was a subject in short on which reflection would be long indulged and must be unavailing she could think of nothing else and yet whether bingley s regard had really died away or were suppressed by his friends interference whether he had been aware of jane s attachment or whether it had escaped his observation whichever were the case though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference her sister s situation remained the same her peace equally wounded a day or two passed before jane had courage to speak of her feelings to elizabeth but at last on mrs bennet s leaving them together after a longer irritation than usual about netherfield and its master she could not help saying o that my dear mother had more command over herself she can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him but i will not repine it cannot last long he will be forgot and we shall all be as we were before elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude but said nothing you doubt me cried jane slightly colouring indeed you have no reason he may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance but that is all i have nothing either to hope or fear and nothing to reproach him with thank god i have not that pain a little time therefore i shall certainly try to get the better with a stronger voice she soon added i have this comfort immediately that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side and that it has done no harm to anyone but myself my dear jane exclaimed elizabeth you are too good your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic i do not know what to say to you i feel as if i had never done you justice or loved you as you deserve miss bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit and threw back the praise on her sister s warm affection nay said elizabeth this is not fair you wish to think all the world respectable and are hurt if i speak ill of anybody i only want to think you perfect and you set yourself against it do not be afraid of my running into any excess of my encroaching on your privilege of universal good will you need not there are few people whom i really love and still fewer of whom i think well the more i see of the world the more am i dissatisfied with it and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit or sense i have met with two instances lately one i will not mention the other is charlotte s marriage it is unaccountable in every view it is unaccountable my dear lizzy do not give way to such feelings as these they will ruin your happiness you do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper consider mr collins s respectability and charlotte s prudent steady character remember that she is one of a large family that as to fortune it is a most eligible match and be ready to believe for everybody s sake that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin to oblige you i would try to believe almost anything but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this for were i persuaded that charlotte had any regard for him i should only think worse of her understanding than i now do of her heart my dear jane mr collins is a conceited pompous narrow minded silly man you know he is as well as i do and you must feel as well as i do that the woman who marries him cannot have a proper way of thinking you shall not defend her though it is charlotte lucas you shall not for the sake of one individual change the meaning of principle and integrity nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me that selfishness is prudence and insensibility of danger security for happiness i must think your language too strong in speaking of both replied jane and i hope you will be convinced of it by seeing them happy together but enough of this you alluded to something else you mentioned two instances i cannot misunderstand you but i entreat you dear lizzy not to pain me by thinking that person to blame and saying your opinion of him is sunk we must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured we must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect it is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us women fancy admiration means more than it does and men take care that they should if it is designedly done they cannot be justified but i have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine i am far from attributing any part of mr bingley s conduct to design said elizabeth but without scheming to do wrong or to make others unhappy there may be error and there may be misery thoughtlessness want of attention to other people s feelings and want of resolution will do the business and do you impute it to either of those yes to the last but if i go on i shall displease you by saying what i think of persons you esteem stop me whilst you can you persist then in supposing his sisters influence him yes in conjunction with his friend i cannot believe it why should they try to influence him they can only wish his happiness and if he is attached to me no other woman can secure it your first position is false they may wish many things besides his happiness they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money great connections and pride beyond a doubt they do wish him to choose miss darcy replied jane but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing they have known her much longer than they have known me no wonder if they love her better but whatever may be their own wishes it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brother s what sister would think herself at liberty to do it unless there were something very objectionable if they believed him attached to me they would not try to part us if he were so they could not succeed by supposing such an affection you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong and me most unhappy do not distress me by the idea i am not ashamed of having been mistaken or at least it is slight it is nothing in comparison of what i should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters let me take it in the best light in the light in which it may be understood elizabeth could not oppose such a wish and from this time mr bingley s name was scarcely ever mentioned between them mrs bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more and though a day seldom passed in which elizabeth did not account for it clearly there seemed little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself that his attentions to jane had been merely the effect of a common and transient liking which ceased when he saw her no more but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time she had the same story to repeat every day mrs bennet s best comfort was that mr bingley must be down again in the summer mr bennet treated the matter differently so lizzy said he one day your sister is crossed in love i find i congratulate her next to being married a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then it is something to think of and gives her a sort of distinction among her companions when is your turn to come you will hardly bear to be long outdone by jane now is your time here are officers enough at meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country let wickham be your man he is a pleasant fellow and would jilt you creditably thank you sir but a less agreeable man would satisfy me we must not all expect jane s good fortune true said mr bennet but it is a comfort to think that whatever of that kind may befall you you have an affectionate mother who will always make the most of it mr wickham s society was of material service in dispelling the gloom which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the longbourn family they saw him often and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve the whole of what elizabeth had already heard his claims on mr darcy and all that he had suffered from him was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed and everybody was pleased to think how much they had always disliked mr darcy before they had known anything of the matter miss bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case unknown to the society of hertfordshire her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances and urged the possibility of mistakes but by everybody else mr darcy was condemned as the worst of men illustration chapter xxv illustration after a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity mr collins was called from his amiable charlotte by the arrival of saturday the pain of separation however might be alleviated on his side by preparations for the reception of his bride as he had reason to hope that shortly after his next return into hertfordshire the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men he took leave of his relations at longbourn with as much solemnity as before wished his fair cousins health and happiness again and promised their father another letter of thanks on the following monday mrs bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife who came as usual to spend the christmas at longbourn mr gardiner was a sensible gentlemanlike man greatly superior to his sister as well by nature as education the netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade and within view of his own warehouses could have been so well bred and agreeable mrs gardiner who was several years younger than mrs bennet and mrs philips was an amiable intelligent elegant woman and a great favourite with her longbourn nieces between the two eldest and herself especially there subsisted a very particular regard they had frequently been staying with her in town the first part of mrs gardiner s business on her arrival was to distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions when this was done she had a less active part to play it became her turn to listen mrs bennet had many grievances to relate and much to complain of they had all been very ill used since she last saw her sister two of her girls had been on the point of marriage and after all there was nothing in it i do not blame jane she continued for jane would have got mr bingley if she could but lizzy oh sister it is very hard to think that she might have been mr collins s wife by this time had not it been for her own perverseness he made her an offer in this very room and she refused him the consequence of it is that lady lucas will have a daughter married before i have and that longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever the lucases are very artful people indeed sister they are all for what they can get i am sorry to say it of them but so it is it makes me very nervous and poorly to be thwarted so in my own family and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else however your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts and i am very glad to hear what you tell us of long sleeves mrs gardiner to whom the chief of this news had been given before in the course of jane and elizabeth s correspondence with her made her sister a slight answer and in compassion to her nieces turned the conversation when alone with elizabeth afterwards she spoke more on the subject it seems likely to have been a desirable match for jane said she i am sorry it went off but these things happen so often a young man such as you describe mr bingley so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks and when accident separates them so easily forgets her that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent illustration offended two or three young ladies copyright by george allen an excellent consolation in its way said elizabeth but it will not do for us we do not suffer by accident it does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in love with only a few days before but that expression of violently in love is so hackneyed so doubtful so indefinite that it gives me very little idea it is as often applied to feelings which arise only from a half hour s acquaintance as to a real strong attachment pray how violent was mr bingley s love i never saw a more promising inclination he was growing quite inattentive to other people and wholly engrossed by her every time they met it was more decided and remarkable at his own ball he offended two or three young ladies by not asking them to dance and i spoke to him twice myself without receiving an answer could there be finer symptoms is not general incivility the very essence of love oh yes of that kind of love which i suppose him to have felt poor jane i am sorry for her because with her disposition she may not get over it immediately it had better have happened to you lizzy you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner but do you think she would be prevailed on to go back with us change of scene might be of service and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as anything elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal and felt persuaded of her sister s ready acquiescence i hope added mrs gardiner that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her we live in so different a part of town all our connections are so different and as you well know we go out so little that it is very improbable they should meet at all unless he really comes to see her and that is quite impossible for he is now in the custody of his friend and mr darcy would no more suffer him to call on jane in such a part of london my dear aunt how could you think of it mr darcy may perhaps have heard of such a place as gracechurch street but he would hardly think a month s ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities were he once to enter it and depend upon it mr bingley never stirs without him so much the better i hope they will not meet at all but does not jane correspond with his sister she will not be able to help calling she will drop the acquaintance entirely but in spite of the certainty in which elizabeth affected to place this point as well as the still more interesting one of bingley s being withheld from seeing jane she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her on examination that she did not consider it entirely hopeless it was possible and sometimes she thought it probable that his affection might be re animated and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of jane s attractions miss bennet accepted her aunt s invitation with pleasure and the bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time than as she hoped by caroline s not living in the same house with her brother she might occasionally spend a morning with her without any danger of seeing him the gardiners stayed a week at longbourn and what with the philipses the lucases and the officers there was not a day without its engagement mrs bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister that they did not once sit down to a family dinner when the engagement was for home some of the officers always made part of it of which officers mr wickham was sure to be one and on these occasions mrs gardiner rendered suspicious by elizabeth s warm commendation of him narrowly observed them both without supposing them from what she saw to be very seriously in love their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy and she resolved to speak to elizabeth on the subject before she left hertfordshire and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment to mrs gardiner wickham had one means of affording pleasure unconnected with his general powers about ten or a dozen years ago before her marriage she had spent a considerable time in that very part of derbyshire to which he belonged they had therefore many acquaintance in common and though wickham had been little there since the death of darcy s father five years before it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way of procuring mrs gardiner had seen pemberley and known the late mr darcy by character perfectly well here consequently was an inexhaustible subject of discourse in comparing her recollection of pemberley with the minute description which wickham could give and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor she was delighting both him and herself on being made acquainted with the present mr darcy s treatment of him she tried to remember something of that gentleman s reputed disposition when quite a lad which might agree with it and was confident at last that she recollected having heard mr fitzwilliam darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud ill natured boy illustration will you come and see me chapter xxvi illustration mrs gardiner s caution to elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone after honestly telling her what she thought she thus went on you are too sensible a girl lizzy to fall in love merely because you are warned against it and therefore i am not afraid of speaking openly seriously i would have you be on your guard do not involve yourself or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent i have nothing to say against him he is a most interesting young man and if he had the fortune he ought to have i should think you could not do better but as it is you must not let your fancy run away with you you have sense and we all expect you to use it your father would depend on your resolution and good conduct i am sure you must not disappoint your father my dear aunt this is being serious indeed yes and i hope to engage you to be serious likewise well then you need not be under any alarm i will take care of myself and of mr wickham too he shall not be in love with me if i can prevent it elizabeth you are not serious now i beg your pardon i will try again at present i am not in love with mr wickham no i certainly am not but he is beyond all comparison the most agreeable man i ever saw and if he becomes really attached to me i believe it will be better that he should not i see the imprudence of it oh that abominable mr darcy my father s opinion of me does me the greatest honour and i should be miserable to forfeit it my father however is partial to mr wickham in short my dear aunt i should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy but since we see every day that where there is affection young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into engagements with each other how can i promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow creatures if i am tempted or how am i even to know that it would be wiser to resist all that i can promise you therefore is not to be in a hurry i will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object when i am in company with him i will not be wishing in short i will do my best perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very often at least you should not remind your mother of inviting him as i did the other day said elizabeth with a conscious smile very true it will be wise in me to refrain from that but do not imagine that he is always here so often it is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week you know my mother s ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends but really and upon my honour i will try to do what i think to be wisest and now i hope you are satisfied her aunt assured her that she was and elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints they parted a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point without being resented mr collins returned into hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the gardiners and jane but as he took up his abode with the lucases his arrival was no great inconvenience to mrs bennet his marriage was now fast approaching and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable and even repeatedly to say in an ill natured tone that she wished they might be happy thursday was to be the wedding day and on wednesday miss lucas paid her farewell visit and when she rose to take leave elizabeth ashamed of her mother s ungracious and reluctant good wishes and sincerely affected herself accompanied her out of the room as they went down stairs together charlotte said i shall depend on hearing from you very often eliza that you certainly shall and i have another favour to ask will you come and see me we shall often meet i hope in hertfordshire i am not likely to leave kent for some time promise me therefore to come to hunsford elizabeth could not refuse though she foresaw little pleasure in the visit my father and maria are to come to me in march added charlotte and i hope you will consent to be of the party indeed eliza you will be as welcome to me as either of them the wedding took place the bride and bridegroom set off for kent from the church door and everybody had as much to say or to hear on the subject as usual elizabeth soon heard from her friend and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it ever had been that it should be equally unreserved was impossible elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over and though determined not to slacken as a correspondent it was for the sake of what had been rather than what was charlotte s first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home how she would like lady catherine and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be though when the letters were read elizabeth felt that charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen she wrote cheerfully seemed surrounded with comforts and mentioned nothing which she could not praise the house furniture neighbourhood and roads were all to her taste and lady catherine s behaviour was most friendly and obliging it was mr collins s picture of hunsford and rosings rationally softened and elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there to know the rest jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in london and when she wrote again elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the bingleys her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is jane had been a week in town without either seeing or hearing from caroline she accounted for it however by supposing that her last letter to her friend from longbourn had by some accident been lost my aunt she continued is going to morrow into that part of the town and i shall take the opportunity of calling in grosvenor street she wrote again when the visit was paid and she had seen miss bingley i did not think caroline in spirits were her words but she was very glad to see me and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to london i was right therefore my last letter had never reached her i inquired after their brother of course he was well but so much engaged with mr darcy that they scarcely ever saw him i found that miss darcy was expected to dinner i wish i could see her my visit was not long as caroline and mrs hurst were going out i dare say i shall soon see them here elizabeth shook her head over this letter it convinced her that accident only could discover to mr bingley her sister s being in town four weeks passed away and jane saw nothing of him she endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it but she could no longer be blind to miss bingley s inattention after waiting at home every morning for a fortnight and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her the visitor did at last appear but the shortness of her stay and yet more the alteration of her manner would allow jane to deceive herself no longer the letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will prove what she felt my dearest lizzy will i am sure be incapable of triumphing in her better judgment at my expense when i confess myself to have been entirely deceived in miss bingley s regard for me but my dear sister though the event has proved you right do not think me obstinate if i still assert that considering what her behaviour was my confidence was as natural as your suspicion i do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me but if the same circumstances were to happen again i am sure i should be deceived again caroline did not return my visit till yesterday and not a note not a line did i receive in the meantime when she did come it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it she made a slight formal apology for not calling before said not a word of wishing to see me again and was in every respect so altered a creature that when she went away i was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer i pity though i cannot help blaming her she was very wrong in singling me out as she did i can safely say that every advance to intimacy began on her side but i pity her because she must feel that she has been acting wrong and because i am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it i need not explain myself farther and though we know this anxiety to be quite needless yet if she feels it it will easily account for her behaviour to me and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister whatever anxiety she may feel on his behalf is natural and amiable i cannot but wonder however at her having any such fears now because if he had at all cared about me we must have met long long ago he knows of my being in town i am certain from something she said herself and yet it would seem by her manner of talking as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to miss darcy i cannot understand it if i were not afraid of judging harshly i should be almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this i will endeavour to banish every painful thought and think only of what will make me happy your affection and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt let me hear from you very soon miss bingley said something of his never returning to netherfield again of giving up the house but not with any certainty we had better not mention it i am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at hunsford pray go to see them with sir william and maria i am sure you will be very comfortable there yours etc this letter gave elizabeth some pain but her spirits returned as she considered that jane would no longer be duped by the sister at least all expectation from the brother was now absolutely over she would not even wish for any renewal of his attentions his character sunk on every review of it and as a punishment for him as well as a possible advantage to jane she seriously hoped he might really soon marry mr darcy s sister as by wickham s account she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away mrs gardiner about this time reminded elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman and required information and elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself his apparent partiality had subsided his attentions were over he was the admirer of some one else elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all but she could see it and write of it without material pain her heart had been but slightly touched and her vanity was satisfied with believing that she would have been his only choice had fortune permitted it the sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable but elizabeth less clear sighted perhaps in this case than in charlotte s did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence nothing on the contrary could be more natural and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both and could very sincerely wish him happy all this was acknowledged to mrs gardiner and after relating the circumstances she thus went on i am now convinced my dear aunt that i have never been much in love for had i really experienced that pure and elevating passion i should at present detest his very name and wish him all manner of evil but my feelings are not only cordial towards him they are even impartial towards miss king i cannot find out that i hate her at all or that i am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl there can be no love in all this my watchfulness has been effectual and though i should certainly be a more interesting object to all my acquaintance were i distractedly in love with him i cannot say that i regret my comparative insignificance importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly kitty and lydia take his defection much more to heart than i do they are young in the ways of the world and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on as well as the plain

sometimes cold did january and february pass away march was to take elizabeth to hunsford she had not at first thought very seriously of going thither but charlotte she soon found was depending on the plan and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty absence had increased her desire of seeing charlotte again and weakened her disgust of mr collins there was novelty in the scheme and as with such a mother and such uncompanionable sisters home could not be faultless a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake the journey would moreover give her a peep at jane and in short as the time drew near she would have been very sorry for any delay everything however went on smoothly and was finally settled according to charlotte s first sketch she was to accompany sir william and his second daughter the improvement of spending a night in london was added in time and the plan became as perfect as plan could be the only pain was in leaving her father who would certainly miss her and who when it came to the point so little liked her going that he told her to write to him and almost promised to answer her letter the farewell between herself and mr wickham was perfectly friendly on his side even more his present pursuit could not make him forget that elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention the first to listen and to pity the first to be admired and in his manner of bidding her adieu wishing her every enjoyment reminding her of what she was to expect in lady catherine de bourgh and trusting their opinion of her their opinion of everybody would always coincide there was a solicitude an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard and she parted from him convinced that whether married or single he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing her fellow travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable sir william lucas and his daughter maria a good humoured girl but as empty headed as himself had nothing to say that could be worth hearing and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise elizabeth loved absurdities but she had known sir william s too long he could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood and his civilities were worn out like his information it was a journey of only twenty four miles and they began it so early as to be in gracechurch street by noon as they drove to mr gardiner s door jane was at a drawing room window watching their arrival when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them and elizabeth looking earnestly in her face was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever on the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls whose eagerness for their cousin s appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawing room and whose shyness as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth prevented their coming lower all was joy and kindness the day passed most pleasantly away the morning in bustle and shopping and the evening at one of the theatres elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt their first subject was her sister and she was more grieved than astonished to hear in reply to her minute inquiries that though jane always struggled to support her spirits there were periods of dejection it was reasonable however to hope that they would not continue long mrs gardiner gave her the particulars also of miss bingley s visit in gracechurch street and repeated conversations occurring at different times between jane and herself which proved that the former had from her heart given up the acquaintance mrs gardiner then rallied her niece on wickham s desertion and complimented her on bearing it so well but my dear elizabeth she added what sort of girl is miss king i should be sorry to think our friend mercenary pray my dear aunt what is the difference in matrimonial affairs between the mercenary and the prudent motive where does discretion end and avarice begin last christmas you were afraid of his marrying me because it would be imprudent and now because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds you want to find out that he is mercenary if you will only tell me what sort of girl miss king is i shall know what to think she is a very good kind of girl i believe i know no harm of her but he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfather s death made her mistress of this fortune no why should he if it were not allowable for him to gain my affections because i had no money what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about and who was equally poor but there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her so soon after this event a man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which other people may observe if she does not object to it why should we her not objecting does not justify him it only shows her being deficient in something herself sense or feeling well cried elizabeth have it as you choose he shall be mercenary and she shall be foolish no lizzy that is what i do not choose i should be sorry you know to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in derbyshire oh if that is all i have a very poor opinion of young men who live in derbyshire and their intimate friends who live in hertfordshire are not much better i am sick of them all thank heaven i am going to morrow where i shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality who has neither manners nor sense to recommend him stupid men are the only ones worth knowing after all take care lizzy that speech savours strongly of disappointment before they were separated by the conclusion of the play she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer we have not quite determined how far it shall carry us said mrs gardiner but perhaps to the lakes no scheme could have been more agreeable to elizabeth and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful my dear dear aunt she rapturously cried what delight what felicity you give me fresh life and vigour adieu to disappointment and spleen what are men to rocks and mountains oh what hours of transport we shall spend and when we do return it shall not be like other travellers without being able to give one accurate idea of anything we will know where we have gone we will recollect what we have seen lakes mountains and rivers shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations nor when we attempt to describe any particular scene will we begin quarrelling about its relative situation let our first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers illustration at the door chapter xxviii illustration every object in the next day s journey was new and interesting to elizabeth and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight when they left the high road for the lane to hunsford every eye was in search of the parsonage and every turning expected to bring it in view the paling of rosings park was their boundary on one side elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants at length the parsonage was discernible the garden sloping to the road the house standing in it the green pales and the laurel hedge everything declared they were arriving mr collins and charlotte appeared at the door and the carriage stopped at the small gate which led by a short gravel walk to the house amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party in a moment they were all out of the chaise rejoicing at the sight of each other mrs collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure and elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming when she found herself so affectionately received she saw instantly that her cousin s manners were not altered by his marriage his formal civility was just what it had been and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his inquiries after all her family they were then with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance taken into the house and as soon as they were in the parlour he welcomed them a second time with ostentatious formality to his humble abode and punctually repeated all his wife s offers of refreshment elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory and she could not help fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room its aspect and its furniture he addressed himself particularly to her as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him but though everything seemed neat and comfortable she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion when mr collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed which certainly was not seldom she involuntarily turned her eye on charlotte once or twice she could discern a faint blush but in general charlotte wisely did not hear after sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room from the sideboard to the fender to give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in london mr collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden which was large and well laid out and to the cultivation of which he attended himself to work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures and elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise and owned she encouraged it as much as possible here leading the way through every walk and cross walk and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind he could number the fields in every direction and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump but of all the views which his garden or which the country or the kingdom could boast none were to be compared with the prospect of rosings afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house it was a handsome modern building well situated on rising ground from his garden mr collins would have led them round his two meadows but the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white frost turned back and while sir william accompanied him charlotte took her sister and friend over the house extremely well pleased probably to have the opportunity of showing it without her husband s help it was rather small but well built and convenient and everything was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which elizabeth gave charlotte all the credit when mr collins could be forgotten there was really a great air of comfort throughout and by charlotte s evident enjoyment of it elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten she had already learnt that lady catherine was still in the country it was spoken of again while they were at dinner when mr collins joining in observed yes miss elizabeth you will have the honour of seeing lady catherine de bourgh on the ensuing sunday at church and i need not say you will be delighted with her she is all affability and condescension and i doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over i have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will include you and my sister maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here her behaviour to my dear charlotte is charming we dine at rosings twice every week and are never allowed to walk home her ladyship s carriage is regularly ordered for us i should say one of her ladyship s carriages for she has several lady catherine is a very respectable sensible woman indeed added charlotte and a most attentive neighbour very true my dear that is exactly what i say she is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference the evening was spent chiefly in talking over hertfordshire news and telling again what had been already written and when it closed elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon charlotte s degree of contentment to understand her address in guiding and composure in bearing with her husband and to acknowledge that it was all done very well she had also to anticipate how her visit would pass the quiet tenour of their usual employments the vexatious interruptions of mr collins and the gaieties of their intercourse with rosings a lively imagination soon settled it all about the middle of the next day as she was in her room getting ready for a walk a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion and after listening a moment she heard somebody running upstairs in a violent hurry and calling loudly after her she opened the door and met maria in the landing place who breathless with agitation cried out illustration in conversation with the ladies copyright by george allen oh my dear eliza pray make haste and come into the dining room for there is such a sight to be seen i will not tell you what it is make haste and come down this moment elizabeth asked questions in vain maria would tell her nothing more and down they ran into the dining room which fronted the lane in quest of this wonder it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate and is this all cried elizabeth i expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden and here is nothing but lady catherine and her daughter la my dear said maria quite shocked at the mistake it is not lady catherine the old lady is mrs jenkinson who lives with them the other is miss de bourgh only look at her she is quite a little creature who would have thought she could be so thin and small she is abominably rude to keep charlotte out of doors in all this wind why does she not come in oh charlotte says she hardly ever does it is the greatest of favours when miss de bourgh comes in i like her appearance said elizabeth struck with other ideas she looks sickly and cross yes she will do for him very well she will make him a very proper wife mr collins and charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies and sir william to elizabeth s high diversion was stationed in the doorway in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him and constantly bowing whenever miss de bourgh looked that way at length there was nothing more to be said the ladies drove on and the others returned into the house mr collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune which charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at rosings the next day illustration lady catherine said she you have given me a treasure copyright by george allen chapter xxix illustration mr collins s triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete the power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife was exactly what he had wished for and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon was such an instance of lady catherine s condescension as he knew not how to admire enough i confess said he that i should not have been at all surprised by her ladyship s asking us on sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at rosings i rather expected from my knowledge of her affability that it would happen but who could have foreseen such an attention as this who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there an invitation moreover including the whole party so immediately after your arrival i am the less surprised at what has happened replied sir william from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire about the court such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon scarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but their visit to rosings mr collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect that the sight of such rooms so many servants and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them when the ladies were separating for the toilette he said to elizabeth do not make yourself uneasy my dear cousin about your apparel lady catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which becomes herself and daughter i would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest there is no occasion for anything more lady catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed she likes to have the distinction of rank preserved while they were dressing he came two or three times to their different doors to recommend their being quick as lady catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner such formidable accounts of her ladyship and her manner of living quite frightened maria lucas who had been little used to company and she looked forward to her introduction at rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done to his presentation at st james s as the weather was fine they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park every park has its beauty and its prospects and elizabeth saw much to be pleased with though she could not be in such raptures as mr collins expected the scene to inspire and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost sir lewis de bourgh when they ascended the steps to the hall maria s alarm was every moment increasing and even sir william did not look perfectly calm elizabeth s courage did not fail her she had heard nothing of lady catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue and the mere stateliness of money and rank she thought she could witness without trepidation from the entrance hall of which mr collins pointed out with a rapturous air the fine proportion and finished ornaments they followed the servants through an antechamber to the room where lady catherine her daughter and mrs jenkinson were sitting her ladyship with great condescension arose to receive them and as mrs collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be hers it was performed in a proper manner without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary in spite of having been at st james s sir william was so completely awed by the grandeur surrounding him that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow and take his seat without saying a word and his daughter frightened almost out of her senses sat on the edge of her chair not knowing which way to look elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene and could observe the three ladies before her composedly lady catherine was a tall large woman with strongly marked features which might once have been handsome her air was not conciliating nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank she was not rendered formidable by silence but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone as marked her self importance and brought mr wickham immediately to elizabeth s mind and from the observation of the day altogether she believed lady catherine to be exactly what he had represented when after examining the mother in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of mr darcy she turned her eyes on the daughter she could almost have joined in maria s astonishment at her being so thin and so small there was neither in figure nor face any likeness between the ladies miss de bourgh was pale and sickly her features though not plain were insignificant and she spoke very little except in a low voice to mrs jenkinson in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes after sitting a few minutes they were all sent to one of the windows to admire the view mr collins attending them to point out its beauties and lady catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer the dinner was exceedingly handsome and there were all the servants and all the articles of plate which mr collins had promised and as he had likewise foretold he took his seat at the bottom of the table by her ladyship s desire and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater he carved and ate and praised with delighted alacrity and every dish was commended first by him and then by sir william who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son in law said in a manner which elizabeth wondered lady catherine could bear but lady catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration and gave most gracious smiles especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them the party did not supply much conversation elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening but she was seated between charlotte and miss de bourgh the former of whom was engaged in listening to lady catherine and the latter said not a word to her all the dinnertime mrs jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little miss de bourgh ate pressing her to try some other dish and fearing she was indisposed maria thought speaking out of the question and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire when the ladies returned to the drawing room there was little to be done but to hear lady catherine talk which she did without any intermission till coffee came in delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have her judgment controverted she inquired into charlotte s domestic concerns familiarly and minutely and gave her a great deal of advice as to the management of them all told her how everything ought to be regulated in so small a family as hers and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great lady s attention which could furnish her with an occasion for dictating to others in the intervals of her discourse with mrs collins she addressed a variety of questions to maria and elizabeth but especially to the latter of whose connections she knew the least and who she observed to mrs collins was a very genteel pretty kind of girl she asked her at different times how many sisters she had whether they were older or younger than herself whether any of them were likely to be married whether they were handsome where they had been educated what carriage her father kept and what had been her mother s maiden name elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions but answered them very composedly lady catherine then observed your father s estate is entailed on mr collins i think for your sake turning to charlotte i am glad of it but otherwise i see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line it was not thought necessary in sir lewis de bourgh s family do you play and sing miss bennet a little oh then some time or other we shall be happy to hear you our instrument is a capital one probably superior to you shall try it some day do your sisters play and sing one of them does why did not you all learn you ought all to have learned the miss webbs all play and their father has not so good an income as yours do you draw no not at all what none of you not one that is very strange but i suppose you had no opportunity your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters my mother would have no objection but my father hates london has your governess left you we never had any governess no governess how was that possible five daughters brought up at home without a governess i never heard of such a thing your mother must have been quite a slave to your education elizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that had not been the case then who taught you who attended to you without a governess you must have been neglected compared with some families i believe we were but such of us as wished to learn never wanted the means we were always encouraged to read and had all the masters that were necessary those who chose to be idle certainly might ay no doubt but that is what a governess will prevent and if i had known your mother i should have advised her most strenuously to engage one i always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction and nobody but a governess can give it it is wonderful how many families i have been the means of supplying in that way i am always glad to get a young person well placed out four nieces of mrs jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means and it was but the other day that i recommended another young person who was merely accidentally mentioned to me and the family are quite delighted with her mrs collins did i tell you of lady metcalfe s calling yesterday to thank me she finds miss pope a treasure lady catherine said she you have given me a treasure are any of your younger sisters out miss bennet yes ma am all all what all five out at once very odd and you only the second the younger ones out before the elder are married your younger sisters must be very young yes my youngest is not sixteen perhaps she is full young to be much in company but really ma am i think it would be very hard upon younger sisters that they should not have their share of society and amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early the last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth as the first and to be kept back on such a motive i think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind upon my word said her ladyship you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person pray what is your age with three younger sisters grown up replied elizabeth smiling your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it lady catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer and elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence you cannot be more than twenty i am sure therefore you need not conceal your age i am not one and twenty when the gentlemen had joined them and tea was over the card tables were placed lady catherine sir william and mr and mrs collins sat down to quadrille and as miss de bourgh chose to play at cassino the two girls had the honour of assisting mrs jenkinson to make up her party their table was superlatively stupid scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game except when mrs jenkinson expressed her fears of miss de bourgh s being too hot or too cold or having too much or too little light a great deal more passed at the other table lady catherine was generally speaking stating the mistakes of the three others or relating some anecdote of herself mr collins was employed in agreeing to everything her ladyship said thanking her for every fish he won and apologizing if he thought he won too many sir william did not say much he was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble names when lady catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose the tables were broken up the carriage was offered to mrs collins gratefully accepted and immediately ordered the party then gathered round the fire to hear lady catherine determine what weather they were to have on the morrow from these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach and with many speeches of thankfulness on mr collins s side and as many bows on sir william s they departed as soon as they had driven from the door elizabeth was called on by her cousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at rosings which for charlotte s sake she made more favourable than it really was but her commendation though costing her some trouble could by no means satisfy mr collins and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyship s praise into his own hands illustration chapter xxx illustration sir william stayed only a week at hunsford but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughter s being most comfortably settled and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with while sir william was with them mr collins devoted his mornings to driving him out in his gig and showing him the country but when he went away the whole family returned to their usual employments and elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden or in reading and writing and looking out of window in his own book room which fronted the road the room in which the ladies sat was backwards elizabeth at first had rather wondered that charlotte should not prefer the dining parlour for common use it was a better sized room and had a pleasanter aspect but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did for mr collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment had they sat in one equally lively and she gave charlotte credit for the arrangement from the drawing room they could distinguish nothing in the lane and were indebted to mr collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along and how often especially miss de bourgh drove by in her phaeton which he never failed coming to inform them of though it happened almost every day she not unfrequently stopped at the parsonage and had a few minutes conversation with charlotte but was scarcely ever prevailed on to get out very few days passed in which mr collins did not walk to rosings and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise and till elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours now and then they were honoured with a call from her ladyship and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits she examined into their employments looked at their work and advised them to do it differently found fault with the arrangement of the furniture or detected the housemaid in negligence and if she accepted any refreshment seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that mrs collins s joints of meat were too large for her family elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the commission of the peace for the county she was a most active magistrate in her own parish the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by mr collins and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome discontented or too poor she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences silence their complaints and scold them into harmony and plenty illustration he never failed to inform them the entertainment of dining at rosings was repeated about twice a week and allowing for the loss of sir william and there being only one card table in the evening every such entertainment was the counterpart of the first their other engagements were few as the style of living of the neighbourhood in general was beyond the collinses reach this however was no evil to elizabeth and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough there were half hours of pleasant conversation with charlotte and the weather was so fine for the time of year that she had often great enjoyment out of doors her favourite walk and where she frequently went while the others were calling on lady catherine was along the open grove which edged that side of the park where there was a nice sheltered path which no one seemed to value but herself and where she felt beyond the reach of lady catherine s curiosity in this quiet way the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away easter was approaching and the week preceding it was to bring an addition to the family at rosings which in so small a circle must be important elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival that mr darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their rosings parties and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless miss bingley s designs on him were by his behaviour to his cousin for whom he was evidently destined by lady catherine who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by miss lucas and herself his arrival was soon known at the parsonage for mr collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into hunsford lane in order to have illustration the gentlemen accompanied him copyright by george allen the earliest assurance of it and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the park hurried home with the great intelligence on the following morning he hastened to rosings to pay his respects there were two nephews of lady catherine to require them for mr darcy had brought with him a colonel fitzwilliam the younger son of his uncle lord and to the great surprise of all the party when mr collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him charlotte had seen them from her husband s room crossing the road and immediately running into the other told the girls what an honour they might expect adding i may thank you eliza for this piece of civility mr darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment before their approach was announced by the door bell and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room colonel fitzwilliam who led the way was about thirty not handsome but in person and address most truly the gentleman mr darcy looked just as he had been used to look in hertfordshire paid his compliments with his usual reserve to mrs collins and whatever might be his feelings towards her friend met her with every appearance of composure elizabeth merely courtesied to him without saying a word colonel fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a well bred man and talked very pleasantly but his cousin after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to mrs collins sat for some time without speaking to anybody at length however his civility was so far awakened as to inquire of elizabeth after the health of her family she answered him in the usual way and after a moment s pause added my eldest sister has been in town these three months have you never happened to see her there she was perfectly sensible that he never had but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the bingleys and jane and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet miss bennet the subject was pursued no further and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away illustration at church chapter xxxi illustration colonel fitzwilliam s manners were very much admired at the parsonage and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of their engagements at rosings it was some days however before they received any invitation thither for while there were visitors in the house they could not be necessary and it was not till easter day almost a week after the gentlemen s arrival that they were honoured by such an attention and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening for the last week they had seen very little of either lady catherine or her daughter colonel fitzwilliam had called at the parsonage more than once during the time but mr darcy they had only seen at church the invitation was accepted of course and at a proper hour they joined the party in lady catherine s drawing room her ladyship received them civilly but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else and she was in fact almost engrossed by her nephews speaking to them especially to darcy much more than to any other person in the room colonel fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them anything was a welcome relief to him at rosings and mrs collins s pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much he now seated himself by her and talked so agreeably of kent and hertfordshire of travelling and staying at home of new books and music that elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before and they conversed with so much spirit and flow as to draw the attention of lady catherine herself as well as of mr darcy his eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity and that her ladyship after a while shared the feeling was more openly acknowledged for she did not scruple to call out what is that you are saying fitzwilliam what is it you are talking of what are you telling miss bennet let me hear what it is we were talking of music madam said he when no longer able to avoid a reply of music then pray speak aloud it is of all subjects my delight i must have my share in the conversation if you are speaking of music there are few people in england i suppose who have more true enjoyment of music than myself or a better natural taste if i had ever learnt i should have been a great proficient and so would anne if her health had allowed her to apply i am confident that she would have performed delightfully how does georgiana get on darcy mr darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister s proficiency i am very glad to hear such a good account of her said lady catherine and pray tell her from me that she cannot expect to excel if she does not practise a great deal i assure you madam he replied that she does not need such advice she practises very constantly so much the better it cannot be done too much and when i next write to her i shall charge her not to neglect it on any account i often tell young ladies that no excellence in music is to be acquired without constant practice i have told miss bennet several times that she will never play really well unless she practises more and though mrs collins has no instrument she is very welcome as i have often told her to come to rosings every day and play on the pianoforte in mrs jenkinson s room she would be in nobody s way you know in that part of the house mr darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt s ill breeding and made no answer when coffee was over colonel fitzwilliam reminded elizabeth of having promised to play to him and she sat down directly to the instrument he drew a chair near her lady catherine listened to half a song and then talked as before to her other nephew till the latter walked away from her and moving with his usual deliberation towards the pianoforte stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer s countenance elizabeth saw what he was doing and at the first convenient pause turned to him with an arch smile and said you mean to frighten me mr darcy by coming in all this state to hear me but i will not be alarmed though your sister does play so well there is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others my courage always rises with every attempt to intimidate me i shall not say that you are mistaken he replied because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you and i have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself and said to colonel fitzwilliam your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me and teach you not to believe a word i say i am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character in a part of the world where i had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit indeed mr darcy it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in hertfordshire and give me leave to say very impolitic too for it is provoking me to retaliate and such things may come out as will shock your relations to hear i am not afraid of you said he smilingly pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of cried colonel fitzwilliam i should like to know how he behaves among strangers you shall hear then but prepare for something very dreadful the first time of my ever seeing him in hertfordshire you must know was at a ball and at this ball what do you think he did he danced only four dances i am sorry to pain you but so it was he danced only four dances though gentlemen were scarce and to my certain knowledge more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner mr darcy you cannot deny the fact i had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party true and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room well colonel fitzwilliam what do i play next my fingers wait your orders perhaps said darcy i should have judged better had i sought an introduction but i am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers shall we ask your cousin the reason of this said elizabeth still addressing colonel fitzwilliam shall we ask him why a man of sense and education and who has lived in the world is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers i can answer your question said fitzwilliam without applying to him it is because he will not give himself the trouble i certainly have not the talent which some people possess said darcy of conversing easily with those i have never seen before i cannot catch their tone of conversation or appear interested in their concerns as i often see done my fingers said elizabeth do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which i see so many women s do they have not the same force or rapidity and do not produce the same expression but then i have always supposed it to be my own fault because i would not take the trouble of practising it is not that i do not believe my fingers as capable as any other woman s of superior execution darcy smiled and said you are perfectly right you have employed your time much better no one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can think anything wanting we neither of us perform to strangers here they were interrupted by lady catherine who called out to know what they were talking of elizabeth immediately began playing again lady catherine approached and after listening for a few minutes said to darcy miss bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more and could have the advantage of a london master she has a very good notion of fingering though her taste is not equal to anne s anne would have been a delightful performer had her health allowed her to learn elizabeth looked at darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin s praise but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love and from the whole of his behaviour to miss de bourgh she derived this comfort for miss bingley that he might have been just as likely to marry her had she been his relation lady catherine continued her remarks on elizabeth s performance mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility and at the request of the gentlemen remained at the instrument till her ladyship s carriage was ready to take them all home illustration chapter xxxii illustration elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning and writing to jane while mrs collins and maria were gone on business into the village when she was startled by a ring at the door the certain signal of a visitor as she had heard no carriage she thought it not unlikely to be lady catherine and under that apprehension was putting away her half finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions when the door opened and to her very great surprise mr darcy and mr darcy only entered the room he seemed astonished too on finding her alone and apologized for his intrusion by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within they then sat down and when her inquiries after rosings were made seemed in danger of sinking into total silence it was absolutely necessary therefore to think of something and in this emergency recollecting when she had seen him last in hertfordshire and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure she observed how very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november mr darcy it must have been a most agreeable surprise to mr bingley to see you all after him so soon for if i recollect right he went but the day before he and his sisters were well i hope when you left london perfectly so i thank you she found that she was to receive no other answer and after a short pause added i think i have understood that mr bingley has not much idea of ever returning to netherfield again i have never heard him say so but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future he has many friends and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing if he means to be but little at netherfield it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely for then we might possibly get a settled family there but perhaps mr bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle i should not be surprised said darcy if he were to give it up as soon as any eligible purchase offers elizabeth made no answer she was afraid of talking longer of his friend and having nothing else to say was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him he took the hint and soon began with this seems a very comfortable house lady catherine i believe did a great deal to it when mr collins first came to hunsford i believe she did and i am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object mr collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife yes indeed his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him or have made him happy if they had my friend has an excellent understanding though i am not certain that i consider her marrying mr collins as the wisest thing she ever did she seems perfectly happy however and in a prudential light it is certainly a very good match for her it must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends an easy distance do you call it it is nearly fifty miles and what is fifty miles of good road little more than half a day s journey yes i call it a very easy distance i should never have considered the distance as one of the advantages of the match cried elizabeth i should never have said mrs collins was settled near her family it is a proof of your own attachment to hertfordshire anything beyond the very neighbourhood of longbourn i suppose would appear far as he spoke there was a sort of smile which elizabeth fancied she understood he must be supposing her to be thinking of jane and netherfield and she blushed as she answered i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family the far and the near must be relative and depend on many varying circumstances where there is fortune to make the expense of travelling unimportant distance becomes no evil but that is not the case here mr and mrs collins have a comfortable income but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys and i am persuaded my friend would not call herself near her family under less than half the present distance mr darcy drew his chair a little towards her and said you cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment you cannot have been always at longbourn elizabeth looked surprised the gentleman experienced some change of feeling he drew back his chair took a newspaper from the table and glancing over it said in a colder voice are you pleased with kent a short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued on either side calm and concise and soon put an end to by the entrance of charlotte and her sister just returned from their walk the t te t te surprised them mr darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on miss bennet and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to anybody went away illustration accompanied by their aunt copyright by george allen what can be the meaning of this said charlotte as soon as he was gone my dear eliza he must be in love with you or he would never have called on us in this familiar way but when elizabeth told of his silence it did not seem very likely even to charlotte s wishes to be the case and after various conjectures they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding anything to do which was the more probable from the time of year all field sports were over within doors there was lady catherine books and a billiard table but gentlemen cannot be always within doors and in the nearness of the parsonage or the pleasantness of the walk to it or of the people who lived in it the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day they called at various times of the morning sometimes separately sometimes together and now and then accompanied by their aunt it was plain to them all that colonel fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society a persuasion which of course recommended him still more and elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him as well as by his evident admiration of her former favourite george wickham and though in comparing them she saw there was less captivating softness in colonel fitzwilliam s manners she believed he might have the best informed mind but why mr darcy came so often to the parsonage it was more difficult to understand it could not be for society as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips and when he did speak it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice a sacrifice to propriety not a pleasure to himself he seldom appeared really animated mrs collins knew not what to make of him colonel fitzwilliam s occasionally laughing at his stupidity proved that he was generally different which her own knowledge of him could not have told her and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of love and the object of that love her friend eliza she set herself seriously to work to find it out she watched him whenever they were at rosings and whenever he came to hunsford but without much success he certainly looked at her friend a great deal but the expression of that look was disputable it was an earnest steadfast gaze but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind she had once or twice suggested to elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her but elizabeth always laughed at the idea and mrs collins did not think it right to press the subject from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt that all her friend s dislike would vanish if she could suppose him to be in her power in her kind schemes for elizabeth she sometimes planned her marrying colonel fitzwilliam he was beyond comparison the pleasantest man he certainly admired her and his situation in life was most eligible but to counterbalance these advantages mr darcy had considerable patronage in the church and his cousin could have none at all illustration on looking up chapter xxxiii illustration more than once did elizabeth in her ramble within the park unexpectedly meet mr darcy she felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought and to prevent its ever happening again took care to inform him at first that it was a favourite haunt of hers how it could occur a second time therefore was very odd yet it did and even the third it seemed like wilful ill nature or a voluntary penance for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal inquiries and an awkward pause and then away but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her he never said a great deal nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much but it struck her in the course of their third encounter that he was asking some odd unconnected questions about her pleasure in being at hunsford her love of solitary walks and her opinion of mr and mrs collins s happiness and that in speaking of rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house he seemed to expect that whenever she came into kent again she would be staying there too his words seemed to imply it could he have colonel fitzwilliam in his thoughts she supposed if he meant anything he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter it distressed her a little and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the parsonage she was engaged one day as she walked in re perusing jane s last letter and dwelling on some passages which proved that jane had not written in spirits when instead of being again surprised by mr darcy she saw on looking up that colonel fitzwilliam was meeting her putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile she said i did not know before that you ever walked this way i have been making the tour of the park he replied as i generally do every year and intended to close it with a call at the parsonage are you going much farther no i should have turned in a moment and accordingly she did turn and they walked towards the parsonage together do you certainly leave kent on saturday said she yes if darcy does not put it off again but i am at his disposal he arranges the business just as he pleases and if not able to please himself in the arrangement he has at least great pleasure in the power of choice i do not know anybody who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than mr darcy he likes to have his own way very well replied colonel fitzwilliam but so we all do it is only that he has better means of having it than many others because he is rich and many others are poor i speak feelingly a younger son you know must be inured to self denial and dependence in my opinion the younger son of an earl can know very little of either now seriously what have you ever known of self denial and dependence when have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose or procuring anything you had a fancy for these are home questions and perhaps i cannot say that i have experienced many hardships of that nature but in matters of greater weight i may suffer from the want of money younger sons cannot marry where they like unless where they like women of fortune which i think they very often do our habits of expense make us too dependent and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money is this thought elizabeth meant for me and she coloured at the idea but recovering herself said in a lively tone and pray what is the usual price of an earl s younger son unless the elder brother is very sickly i suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds he answered her in the same style and the subject dropped to interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed she soon afterwards said i imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal i wonder he does not marry to secure a lasting convenience of that kind but perhaps his sister does as well for the present and as she is under his sole care he may do what he likes with her no said colonel fitzwilliam that is an advantage which he must divide with me i am joined with him in the guardianship of miss darcy are you indeed and pray what sort of a guardian do you make does your charge give you much trouble young ladies of her age are sometimes a little difficult to manage and if she has the true darcy spirit she may like to have her own way as she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed miss darcy likely to give them any uneasiness convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth she directly replied you need not be frightened i never heard any harm of her and i dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world she is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance mrs hurst and miss bingley i think i have heard you say that you know them i know them a little their brother is a pleasant gentlemanlike man he is a great friend of darcy s oh yes said elizabeth drily mr darcy is uncommonly kind to mr bingley and takes a prodigious deal of care of him care of him yes i really believe darcy does take care of him in those points where he most wants care from something that he told me in our journey hither i have reason to think bingley very much indebted to him but i ought to beg his pardon for i have no right to suppose that bingley was the person meant it was all conjecture what is it you mean it is a circumstance which darcy of course could not wish to be generally known because if it were to get round to the lady s family it would be an unpleasant thing you may depend upon my not mentioning it and remember that i have not much reason for supposing it to be bingley what he told me was merely this that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage but without mentioning names or any other particulars and i only suspected it to be bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer did mr darcy give you his reasons for this interference i understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady and what arts did he use to separate them he did not talk to me of his own arts said fitzwilliam smiling he only told me what i have now told you elizabeth made no answer and walked on her heart swelling with indignation after watching her a little fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful i am thinking of what you have been telling me said she your cousin s conduct does not suit my feelings why was he to be the judge you are rather disposed to call his interference officious i do not see what right mr darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend s inclination or why upon his own judgment alone he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy but she continued recollecting herself as we know none of the particulars it is not fair to condemn him it is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case that is not an unnatural surmise said fitzwilliam but it is lessening the honour of my cousin s triumph very sadly this was spoken jestingly but it appeared to her so just a picture of mr darcy that she would not trust herself with an answer and therefore abruptly changing the conversation talked on indifferent matters till they reached the parsonage there shut into her own room as soon as their visitor left them she could think without interruption of all that she had heard it was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected there could not exist in the world two men over whom mr darcy could have such boundless influence that he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate mr bingley and jane she had never doubted but she had always attributed to miss bingley the principal design and arrangement of them if his own vanity however did not mislead him he was the cause his pride and caprice were the cause of all that jane had suffered and still continued to suffer he had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate generous heart in the world and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted there were some very strong objections against the lady were colonel fitzwilliam s words and these strong objections probably were her having one uncle who was a country attorney and another who was in business in london to jane herself she exclaimed there could be no possibility of objection all loveliness and goodness as she is her understanding excellent her mind improved and her manners captivating neither could anything be urged against my father who though with some peculiarities has abilities which mr darcy himself need not disdain and respectability which he will probably never reach when she thought of her mother indeed her confidence gave way a little but she would not allow that any objections there had material weight with mr darcy whose pride she was convinced would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend s connections than from their want of sense and she was quite decided at last that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride and partly by the wish of retaining mr bingley for his sister the agitation and tears which the subject occasioned brought on a headache and it grew so much worse towards the evening that added to her unwillingness to see mr darcy it determined her not to attend her cousins to rosings where they were engaged to drink tea mrs collins seeing that she was really unwell did not press her to go and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her but mr collins could not conceal his apprehension of lady catherine s being rather displeased by her staying at home illustration chapter xxxiv illustration when they were gone elizabeth as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against mr darcy chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which jane had written to her since her being in kent they contained no actual complaint nor was there any revival of past occurrences or any communication of present suffering but in all and in almost every line of each there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style and which proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and kindly disposed towards everyone had been scarcely ever clouded elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal mr darcy s shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict gave her a keener sense of her sister s sufferings it was some consolation to think that his visit to rosings was to end on the day after the next and a still greater that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with jane again and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits by all that affection could do she could not think of darcy s leaving kent without remembering that his cousin was to go with him but colonel fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all and agreeable as he was she did not mean to be unhappy about him while settling this point she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door bell and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being colonel fitzwilliam himself who had once before called late in the evening and might now come to inquire particularly after her but this idea was soon banished and her spirits were very differently affected when to her utter amazement she saw mr darcy walk into the room in a hurried manner he immediately began an inquiry after her health imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better she answered him with cold civility he sat down for a few moments and then getting up walked about the room elizabeth was surprised but said not a word after a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an agitated manner and thus began in vain have i struggled it will not do my feelings will not be repressed you must allow me to tell you how ardently i admire and love you elizabeth s astonishment was beyond expression she stared coloured doubted and was silent this he considered sufficient encouragement and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her immediately followed he spoke well but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride his sense of her inferiority of its being a degradation of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding but was very unlikely to recommend his suit in spite of her deeply rooted dislike she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a man s affection and though her intentions did not vary for an instant she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive till roused to resentment by his subsequent language she lost all compassion in anger she tried however to compose herself to answer him with patience when he should have done he concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which in spite of all his endeavours he had found impossible to conquer and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand as he said this she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer he spoke of apprehension and anxiety but his countenance expressed real security such a circumstance could only exasperate farther and when he ceased the colour rose into her cheeks and she said in such cases as this it is i believe the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed however unequally they may be returned it is natural that obligation should be felt and if i could feel gratitude i would now thank you but i cannot i have never desired your good opinion and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly i am sorry to have occasioned pain to anyone it has been most unconsciously done however and i hope will be of short duration the feelings which you tell me have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation mr darcy who was leaning against the mantel piece with his eyes fixed on her face seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise his complexion became pale with anger and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature he was struggling for the appearance of composure and would not open his lips till he believed himself to have attained it the pause was to elizabeth s feelings dreadful at length in a voice of forced calmness he said and this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of expecting i might perhaps wish to be informed why with so little endeavour at civility i am thus rejected but it is of small importance i might as well inquire replied she why with so evident a design of offending and insulting me you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will against your reason and even against your character was not this some excuse for incivility if i was uncivil but i have other provocations you know i have had not my own feelings decided against you had they been indifferent or had they even been favourable do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has been the means of ruining perhaps for ever the happiness of a most beloved sister as she pronounced these words mr darcy changed colour but the emotion was short and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued i have every reason in the world to think ill of you no motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there you dare not you cannot deny that you have been the principal if not the only means of dividing them from each other of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability the other to its derision for disappointed hopes and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind she paused and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse he even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity can you deny that you have done it she repeated with assumed tranquillity he then replied i have no wish of denying that i did everything in my power to separate my friend from your sister or that i rejoice in my success towards him i have been kinder than towards myself elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection but its meaning did not escape nor was it likely to conciliate her but it is not merely this affair she continued on which my dislike is founded long before it had taken place my opinion of you was decided your character was unfolded in the recital which i received many months ago from mr wickham on this subject what can you have to say in what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others you take an eager interest in that gentleman s concerns said darcy in a less tranquil tone and with a heightened colour who that knows what his misfortunes have been can help feeling an interest in him his misfortunes repeated darcy contemptuously yes his misfortunes have been great indeed and of your infliction cried elizabeth with energy you have reduced him to his present state of poverty comparative poverty you have withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for him you have deprived the best years of his life of that independence which was no less his due than his desert you have done all this and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule and this cried darcy as he walked with quick steps across the room is your opinion of me this is the estimation in which you hold me i thank you for explaining it so fully my faults according to this calculation are heavy indeed but perhaps added he stopping in his walk and turning towards her these offences might have been overlooked had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design these bitter accusations might have been suppressed had i with greater policy concealed my struggles and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified unalloyed inclination by reason by reflection by everything but disguise of every sort is my abhorrence nor am i ashamed of the feelings i related they were natural and just could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections to congratulate myself on the hope of relations whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said you are mistaken mr darcy if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way than as it spared me the concern which i might have felt in refusing you had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner she saw him start at this but he said nothing and she continued you could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it again his astonishment was obvious and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification she went on from the very beginning from the first moment i may almost say of my acquaintance with you your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance your conceit and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others were such as to form that groundwork of disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immovable a dislike and i had not known you a month before i felt that you were the last man in the world whom i could ever be prevailed on to marry you have said quite enough madam i perfectly comprehend your feelings and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been forgive me for having taken up so much of your time and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness and with these words he hastily left the room and elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house the tumult of her mind was now painfully great she knew not how to support herself and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an hour her astonishment as she reflected on what had passed was increased by every review of it that she should receive an offer of marriage from mr darcy that he should have been in love with her for so many months so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend s marrying her sister and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case was almost incredible it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection but his pride his abominable pride his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to jane his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging though he could not justify it and the unfeeling manner which he had mentioned mr wickham his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited she continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of lady catherine s carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter charlotte s observation and hurried her away to her room illustration hearing herself called chapter xxxv illustration elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes she could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened it was impossible to think of anything else and totally indisposed for employment she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise she was proceeding directly to her favourite walk when the recollection of mr darcy s sometimes coming there stopped her and instead of entering the park she turned up the lane which led her farther from the turnpike road the park paling was still the boundary on one side and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground after walking two or three times along that part of the lane she was tempted by the pleasantness of the morning to stop at the gates and look into the park the five weeks which she had now passed in kent had made a great difference in the country and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees she was on the point of continuing her walk when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park he was moving that way and fearful of its being mr darcy she was directly retreating but the person who advanced was now near enough to see her and stepping forward with eagerness pronounced her name she had turned away but on hearing herself called though in a voice which proved it to be mr darcy she moved again towards the gate he had by that time reached it also and holding out a letter which she instinctively took said with a look of haughty composure i have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you will you do me the honour of reading that letter and then with a slight bow turned again into the plantation and was soon out of sight with no expectation of pleasure but with the strongest curiosity elizabeth opened the letter and to her still increasing wonder perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper written quite through in a very close hand the envelope itself was likewise full pursuing her way along the lane she then began it it was dated from rosings at eight o clock in the morning and was as follows be not alarmed madam on receiving this letter by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments or renewal of those offers which were last night so disgusting to you i write without any intention of paining you or humbling myself by dwelling on wishes which for the happiness of both cannot be too soon forgotten and the effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion should have been spared had not my character required it to be written and read you must therefore pardon the freedom with which i demand your attention your feelings i know will bestow it unwillingly but i demand it of your justice two offences of a very different nature and by no means of equal magnitude you last night laid to my charge the first mentioned was that regardless of the sentiments of either i had detached mr bingley from your sister and the other that i had in defiance of various claims in defiance of honour and humanity ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the prospects of mr wickham wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth the acknowledged favourite of my father a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage and who had been brought up to expect its exertion would be a depravity to which the separation of two young persons whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks could bear no comparison but from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed respecting each circumstance i shall hope to be in future secured when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read if in the explanation of them which is due to myself i am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to yours i can only say that i am sorry the necessity must be obeyed and further apology would be absurd i had not been long in hertfordshire before i saw in common with others that bingley preferred your elder sister to any other young woman in the country but it was not till the evening of the dance at netherfield that i had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment i had often seen him in love before at that ball while i had the honour of dancing with you i was first made acquainted by sir william lucas s accidental information that bingley s attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage he spoke of it as a certain event of which the time alone could be undecided from that moment i observed my friend s behaviour attentively and i could then perceive that his partiality for miss bennet was beyond what i had ever witnessed in him your sister i also watched her look and manners were open cheerful and engaging as ever but without any symptom of peculiar regard and i remained convinced from the evening s scrutiny that though she received his attentions with pleasure she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment if you have not been mistaken here i must have been in an error your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable if it be so if i have been misled by such error to inflict pain on her your resentment has not been unreasonable but i shall not scruple to assert that the serenity of your sister s countenance and air was such as might have given the most acute observer a conviction that however amiable her temper her heart was not likely to be easily touched that i was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain but i will venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears i did not believe her to be indifferent because i wished it i believed it on impartial conviction as truly as i wished it in reason my objections to the marriage were not merely those which i last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside in my own case the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me but there were other causes of repugnance causes which though still existing and existing to an equal degree in both instances i had myself endeavoured to forget because they were not immediately before me these causes must be stated though briefly the situation of your mother s family though objectionable was nothing in comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently so almost uniformly betrayed by herself by your three younger sisters and occasionally even by your father pardon me it pains me to offend you but amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations and your displeasure at this representation of them let it give you consolation to consider that to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both i will only say farther that from what passed that evening my opinion of all parties was confirmed and every inducement heightened which could have led me before to preserve my friend from what i esteemed a most unhappy connection he left netherfield for london on the day following as you i am certain remember with the design of soon returning the part which i acted is now to be explained his sisters uneasiness had been equally excited with my own our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered and alike sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother we shortly resolved on joining him directly in london we accordingly went and there i readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice i described and enforced them earnestly but however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination i do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage had it not been seconded by the assurance which i hesitated not in giving of your sister s indifference he had before believed her to return his affection with sincere if not with equal regard but bingley has great natural modesty with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own to convince him therefore that he had deceived himself was no very difficult point to persuade him against returning into hertfordshire when that conviction had been given was scarcely the work of a moment i cannot blame myself for having done thus much there is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on which i do not reflect with satisfaction it is that i condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister s being in town i knew it myself as it was known to miss bingley but her brother is even yet ignorant of it that they might have met without ill consequence is perhaps probable but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger perhaps this concealment this disguise was beneath me it is done however and it was done for the best on this subject i have nothing more to say no other apology to offer if i have wounded your sister s feelings it was unknowingly done and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient i have not yet learnt to condemn them with respect to that other more weighty accusation of having injured mr wickham i can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family of what he has particularly accused me i am ignorant but of the truth of what i shall relate i can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity mr wickham is the son of a very respectable man who had for many years the management of all the pemberley estates and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service to him and on george wickham who was his godson his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed my father supported him at school and afterwards at cambridge most important assistance as his own father always poor from the extravagance of his wife would have been unable to give him a gentleman s education my father was not only fond of this young man s society whose manners were always engaging he had also the highest opinion of him and hoping the church would be his profession intended to provide for him in it as for myself it is many many years since i first began to think of him in a very different manner the vicious propensities the want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments which mr darcy could not have here again i shall give you pain to what degree you only can tell but whatever may be the sentiments which mr wickham has created a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character it adds even another motive my excellent father died about five years ago and his attachment to mr wickham was to the last so steady that in his will he particularly recommended it to me to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow and if he took orders desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as it became vacant there was also a legacy of one thousand pounds his own father did not long survive mine and within half a year from these events mr wickham wrote to inform me that having finally resolved against taking orders he hoped i should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage in lieu of the preferment by which he could not be benefited he had some intention he added of studying the law and i must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein i rather wished than believed him to be sincere but at any rate was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal i knew that mr wickham ought not to be a clergyman the business was therefore soon settled he resigned all claim to assistance in the church were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it and accepted in return three thousand pounds all connection between us seemed now dissolved i thought too ill of him to invite him to pemberley or admit his society in town in town i believe he chiefly lived but his studying the law was a mere pretence and being now free from all restraint his life was a life of idleness and dissipation for about three years i heard little of him but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him he applied to me again by letter for the presentation his circumstances he assured me and i had no difficulty in believing it were exceedingly bad he had found the law a most unprofitable study and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained if i would present him to the living in question of which he trusted there could be little doubt as he was well assured that i had no other person to provide for and i could not have forgotten my revered father s intentions you will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty or for resisting every repetition of it his resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others as in his reproaches to myself after this period every appearance of acquaintance was dropped how he lived i know not but last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice i must now mention a circumstance which i would wish to forget myself and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being having said thus much i feel no doubt of your secrecy my sister who is more than ten years my junior was left to the guardianship of my mother s nephew colonel fitzwilliam and myself about a year ago she was taken from school and an establishment formed for her in london and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it to ramsgate and thither also went mr wickham undoubtedly by design for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and mrs younge in whose character we were most unhappily deceived and by her connivance and aid he so far recommended himself to georgiana whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child that she was persuaded to believe herself in love and to consent to an elopement she was then but fifteen which must be her excuse and after stating her imprudence i am happy to add that i owed the knowledge of it to herself i joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement and then georgiana unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father acknowledged the whole to me you may imagine what i felt and how i acted regard for my sister s credit and feelings prevented any public exposure but i wrote to mr wickham who left the place immediately and mrs younge was of course removed from her charge mr wickham s chief object was unquestionably my sister s fortune which is thirty thousand pounds but i cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me was a strong inducement his revenge would have been complete indeed this madam is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together and if you do not absolutely reject it as false you will i hope acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards mr wickham i know not in what manner under what form of falsehood he has imposed on you but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning either detection could not be in your power and suspicion certainly not in your inclination you may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night but i was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed for the truth of everything here related i can appeal more particularly to the testimony of colonel fitzwilliam who from our near relationship and constant intimacy and still more as one of the executors of my father s will has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions if your abhorrence of me should make my assertions valueless you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin and that there may be the possibility of consulting him i shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning i will only add god bless you fitzwilliam darcy illustration chapter xxxvi illustration elizabeth when mr darcy gave her the letter did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers she had formed no expectation at all of its contents but such as they were it may be well supposed how eagerly she went through them and what a contrariety of emotion they excited her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined with amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to give which a just sense of shame would not conceal with a strong prejudice against everything he might say she began his account of what had happened at netherfield she read with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes his belief of her sister s insensibility she instantly resolved to be false and his account of the real the worst objections to the match made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice he expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her his style was not penitent but haughty it was all pride and insolence but when this subject was succeeded by his account of mr wickham when she read with somewhat clearer attention a relation of events which if true must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition astonishment apprehension and even horror oppressed her she wished to discredit it entirely repeatedly exclaiming this must be false this cannot be this must be the grossest falsehood and when she had gone through the whole letter though scarcely knowing anything of the last page or two put it hastily away protesting that she would not regard it that she would never look in it again in this perturbed state of mind with thoughts that could rest on nothing she walked on but it would not do in half a minute the letter was unfolded again and collecting herself as well as she could she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to wickham and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence the account of his connection with the pemberley family was exactly what he had related himself and the kindness of the late mr darcy though she had not before known its extent agreed equally well with his own words so far each recital confirmed the other but when she came to the will the difference was great what wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory and as she recalled his very words it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other and for a few moments she flattered herself that her wishes did not err but when she read and re read with the closest attention the particulars immediately following of wickham s resigning all pretensions to the living of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds again was she forced to hesitate she put down the letter weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality deliberated on the probability of each statement but with little success on both sides it was only assertion again she read on but every line proved more clearly that the affair which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to render mr darcy s conduct in it less than infamous was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole the extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to mr wickham s charge exceedingly shocked her the more so as she could bring no proof of its injustice she had never heard of him before his entrance into the shire militia in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man who on meeting him accidentally in town had there renewed a slight acquaintance of his former way of life nothing had been known in hertfordshire but what he told illustration meeting accidentally in town copyright by george allen himself as to his real character had information been in her power she had never felt a wish of inquiring his countenance voice and manner had established him at once in the possession of every virtue she tried to recollect some instance of goodness some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence that might rescue him from the attacks of mr darcy or at least by the predominance of virtue atone for those casual errors under which she would endeavour to class what mr darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance but no such recollection befriended her she could see him instantly before her in every charm of air and address but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess after pausing on this point a considerable while she once more continued to read but alas the story which followed of his designs on miss darcy received some confirmation from what had passed between colonel fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to colonel fitzwilliam himself from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin s affairs and whose character she had no reason to question at one time she had almost resolved on applying to him but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application and at length wholly banished by the conviction that mr darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal if he had not been well assured of his cousin s corroboration she perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conversation between wickham and herself in their first evening at mr philips s many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory she was now struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger and wondered it had escaped her before she saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct she remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing mr darcy that mr darcy might leave the country but that he should stand his ground yet he had avoided the netherfield ball the very next week she remembered also that till the netherfield family had quitted the country he had told his story to no one but herself but that after their removal it had been everywhere discussed that he had then no reserves no scruples in sinking mr darcy s character though he had assured her that respect for the father would always prevent his exposing the son how differently did everything now appear in which he was concerned his attentions to miss king were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes but his eagerness to grasp at anything his behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shown every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter and in further justification of mr darcy she could not but allow that mr bingley when questioned by jane had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair that proud and repulsive as were his manners she had never in the whole course of their acquaintance an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways seen anything that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust anything that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits that among his own connections he was esteemed and valued that even wickham had allowed him merit as a brother and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling that had his actions been what wickham represented them so gross a violation of everything right could hardly have been concealed from the world and that friendship between a person capable of it and such an amiable man as mr bingley was incomprehensible she grew absolutely ashamed of herself of neither darcy nor wickham could she think without feeling that she had been blind partial prejudiced absurd how despicably have i acted she cried i who have prided myself on my discernment i who have valued myself on my abilities who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister and gratified my vanity in useless or blameless distrust how humiliating is this discovery yet how just a humiliation had i been in love i could not have been more wretchedly blind but vanity not love has been my folly pleased with the preference of one and offended by the neglect of the other on the very beginning of our acquaintance i have courted prepossession and ignorance and driven reason away where either were concerned till this moment i never knew myself from herself to jane from jane to bingley her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that mr darcy s explanation there had appeared very insufficient and she read it again widely different was the effect of a second perusal how could she deny that credit to his assertions in one instance which she had been obliged to give in the other he declared himself to have been totally unsuspicious of her sister s attachment and she could not help remembering what charlotte s opinion had always been neither could she deny the justice of his description of jane she felt that jane s feelings though fervent were little displayed and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner not often united with great sensibility when she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned in tones of such mortifying yet merited reproach her sense of shame was severe the justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded as having passed at the netherfield ball and as confirming all his first disapprobation could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers the compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt it soothed but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus self attracted by the rest of her family and as she considered that jane s disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct she felt depressed beyond anything she had ever known before after wandering along the lane for two hours giving way to every variety of thought reconsidering events determining probabilities and reconciling herself as well as she could to a change so sudden and so important fatigue and a recollection of her long absence made her at length return home and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation she was immediately told that the two gentlemen from rosings had each called during her absence mr darcy only for a few minutes to take leave but that colonel fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour hoping for her return and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found elizabeth could but just affect concern in missing him she really rejoiced at it colonel fitzwilliam was no longer an object she could think only of her letter illustration his parting obeisance chapter xxxvii illustration the two gentlemen left rosings the next morning and mr collins having been in waiting near the lodges to make them his parting obeisance was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence of their appearing in very good health and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at rosings to rosings he then hastened to console lady catherine and her daughter and on his return brought back with great satisfaction a message from her ladyship importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her elizabeth could not see lady catherine without recollecting that had she chosen it she might by this time have been presented to her as her future niece nor could she think without a smile of what her ladyship s indignation would have been what would she have said how would she have behaved were the questions with which she amused herself their first subject was the diminution of the rosings party i assure you i feel it exceedingly said lady catherine i believe nobody feels the loss of friends so much as i do but i am particularly attached to these young men and know them to be so much attached to me they were excessively sorry to go but so they always are the dear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last but darcy seemed to feel it most acutely more i think than last year his attachment to rosings certainly increases mr collins had a compliment and an allusion to throw in here which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter lady catherine observed after dinner that miss bennet seemed out of spirits and immediately accounting for it herself by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon she added but if that is the case you must write to your mother to beg that you may stay a little longer mrs collins will be very glad of your company i am sure i am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation replied elizabeth but it is not in my power to accept it i must be in town next saturday why at that rate you will have been here only six weeks i expected you to stay two months i told mrs collins so before you came there can be no occasion for your going so soon mrs bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight but my father cannot he wrote last week to hurry my return illustration dawson copyright by george allen oh your father of course may spare you if your mother can daughters are never of so much consequence to a father and if you will stay another month complete it will be in my power to take one of you as far as london for i am going there early in june for a week and as dawson does not object to the barouche box there will be very good room for one of you and indeed if the weather should happen to be cool i should not object to taking you both as you are neither of you large you are all kindness madam but i believe we must abide by our original plan lady catherine seemed resigned mrs collins you must send a servant with them you know i always speak my mind and i cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves it is highly improper you must contrive to send somebody i have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing young women should always be properly guarded and attended according to their situation in life when my niece georgiana went to ramsgate last summer i made a point of her having two men servants go with her miss darcy the daughter of mr darcy of pemberley and lady anne could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner i am excessively attentive to all those things you must send john with the young ladies mrs collins i am glad it occurred to me to mention it for it would really be discreditable to you to let them go alone my uncle is to send a servant for us oh your uncle he keeps a man servant does he i am very glad you have somebody who thinks of those things where shall you change horses oh bromley of course if you mention my name at the bell you will be attended to lady catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey and as she did not answer them all herself attention was necessary which elizabeth believed to be lucky for her or with a mind so occupied she might have forgotten where she was reflection must be reserved for solitary hours whenever she was alone she gave way to it as the greatest relief and not a day went by without a solitary walk in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections mr darcy s letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart she studied every sentence and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different when she remembered the style of his address she was still full of indignation but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him her anger was turned against herself and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion his attachment excited gratitude his general character respect but she could not approve him nor could she for a moment repent her refusal or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again in her own past behaviour there was a constant source of vexation and regret and in the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet heavier chagrin they were hopeless of remedy her father contented with laughing at them would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters and her mother with manners so far from right herself was entirely insensible of the evil elizabeth had frequently united with jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of catherine and lydia but while they were supported by their mother s indulgence what chance could there be of improvement catherine weak spirited irritable and completely under lydia s guidance had been always affronted by their advice and lydia self willed and careless would scarcely give them a hearing they were ignorant idle and vain while there was an officer in meryton they would flirt with him and while meryton was within a walk of longbourn they would be going there for ever anxiety on jane s behalf was another prevailing concern and mr darcy s explanation by restoring bingley to all her former good opinion heightened the sense of what jane had lost his affection was proved to have been sincere and his conduct cleared of all blame unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend how grievous then was the thought that of a situation so desirable in every respect so replete with advantage so promising for happiness jane had been deprived by the folly and indecorum of her own family when to these recollections was added the development of wickham s character it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful their engagements at rosings were as frequent during the last week of her stay as they had been at first the very last evening was spent there and her ladyship again inquired minutely into the particulars of their journey gave them directions as to the best method of packing and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way that maria thought herself obliged on her return to undo all the work of the morning and pack her trunk afresh when they parted lady catherine with great condescension wished them a good journey and invited them to come to hunsford again next year and miss de bourgh exerted herself so far as to courtesy and hold out her hand to both illustration the elevation of his feelings chapter xxxviii illustration on saturday morning elizabeth and mr collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary i know not miss elizabeth said he whether mrs collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us but i am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it the favour of your company has been much felt i assure you we know how little there is to tempt anyone to our humble abode our plain manner of living our small rooms and few domestics and the little we see of the world must make hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself but i hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension and that we have done everything in our power to prevent you spending your time unpleasantly elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness she had spent six weeks with great enjoyment and the pleasure of being with charlotte and the kind attention she had received must make her feel the obliged mr collins was gratified and with a more smiling solemnity replied it gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably we have certainly done our best and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society and from our connection with rosings the frequent means of varying the humble home scene i think we may flatter ourselves that your hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome our situation with regard to lady catherine s family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast you see on what a footing we are you see how continually we are engaged there in truth i must acknowledge that with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage i should not think anyone abiding in it an object of compassion while they are sharers of our intimacy at rosings words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings and he was obliged to walk about the room while elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences you may in fact carry a very favourable report of us into hertfordshire my dear cousin i flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so lady catherine s great attentions to mrs collins you have been a daily witness of and altogether i trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate but on this point it will be as well to be silent only let me assure you my dear miss elizabeth that i can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage my dear charlotte and i have but one mind and one way of thinking there is in everything a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us we seem to have been designed for each other elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts she was not sorry however to have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from whom they sprang poor charlotte it was melancholy to leave her to such society but she had chosen it with her eyes open and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go she did not seem to ask for compassion her home and her housekeeping her parish and her poultry and all their dependent concerns had not yet lost their charms at length the chaise arrived the trunks were fastened on the parcels placed within and it was pronounced to be ready after an affectionate parting between the friends elizabeth was attended to the carriage by mr collins and as they walked down the garden he was commissioning her with his best respects to all her family not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at longbourn in the winter and his compliments to mr and mrs gardiner though unknown he then handed her in maria followed and the door was on the point of being closed when he suddenly reminded them with some consternation that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of rosings illustration they had forgotten to leave any message but he added you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here elizabeth made no objection the door was then allowed to be shut and the carriage drove off good gracious cried maria after a few minutes silence it seems but a day or two since we first came and yet how many things have happened a great many indeed said her companion with a sigh we have dined nine times at rosings besides drinking tea there twice how much i shall have to tell elizabeth privately added and how much i shall have to conceal their journey was performed without much conversation or any alarm and within four hours of their leaving hunsford they reached mr gardiner s house where they were to remain a few days jane looked well and elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them but jane was to go home with her and at longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation it was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for longbourn before she told her sister of mr darcy s proposals to know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish jane and must at the same time so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered but the state of indecision in which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate and her fear if she once entered on the subject of being hurried into repeating something of bingley which might only grieve her sister further illustration how nicely we are crammed in chapter xxxix illustration it was the second week in may in which the three young ladies set out together from gracechurch street for the town of in hertfordshire and as they drew near the appointed inn where mr bennet s carriage was to meet them they quickly perceived in token of the coachman s punctuality both kitty and lydia looking out of a dining room upstairs these two girls had been above an hour in the place happily employed in visiting an opposite milliner watching the sentinel on guard and dressing a salad and cucumber after welcoming their sisters they triumphantly displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords exclaiming is not this nice is not this an agreeable surprise and we mean to treat you all added lydia but you must lend us the money for we have just spent ours at the shop out there then showing her purchases look here i have bought this bonnet i do not think it is very pretty but i thought i might as well buy it as not i shall pull it to pieces as soon as i get home and see if i can make it up any better and when her sisters abused it as ugly she added with perfect unconcern oh but there were two or three much uglier in the shop and when i have bought some prettier coloured satin to trim it with fresh i think it will be very tolerable besides it will not much signify what one wears this summer after the shire have left meryton and they are going in a fortnight are they indeed cried elizabeth with the greatest satisfaction they are going to be encamped near brighton and i do so want papa to take us all there for the summer it would be such a delicious scheme and i dare say would hardly cost anything at all mamma would like to go too of all things only think what a miserable summer else we shall have yes thought elizabeth that would be a delightful scheme indeed and completely do for us at once good heaven brighton and a whole campful of soldiers to us who have been overset already by one poor regiment of militia and the monthly balls of meryton now i have got some news for you said lydia as they sat down to table what do you think it is excellent news capital news and about a certain person that we all like jane and elizabeth looked at each other and the waiter was told that he need not stay lydia laughed and said ay that is just like your formality and discretion you thought the waiter must not hear as if he cared i dare say he often hears worse things said than i am going to say but he is an ugly fellow i am glad he is gone i never saw such a long chin in my life well but now for my news it is about dear wickham too good for the waiter is not it there is no danger of wickham s marrying mary king there s for you she is gone down to her uncle at liverpool gone to stay wickham is safe and mary king is safe added elizabeth safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune she is a great fool for going away if she liked him but i hope there is no strong attachment on either side said jane i am sure there is not on his i will answer for it he never cared three straws about her who could about such a nasty little freckled thing elizabeth was shocked to think that however incapable of such coarseness of expression herself the coarseness of the sentiment was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied liberal as soon as all had ate and the elder ones paid the carriage was ordered and after some contrivance the whole party with all their boxes workbags and parcels and the unwelcome addition of kitty s and lydia s purchases were seated in it how nicely we are crammed in cried lydia i am glad i brought my bonnet if it is only for the fun of having another band box well now let us be quite comfortable and snug and talk and laugh all the way home and in the first place let us hear what has happened to you all since you went away have you seen any pleasant men have you had any flirting i was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back jane will be quite an old maid soon i declare she is almost three and twenty lord how ashamed i should be of not being married before three and twenty my aunt philips wants you so to get husbands you can t think she says lizzy had better have taken mr collins but i do not think there would have been any fun in it lord how i should like to be married before any of you and then i would chaperon you about to all the balls dear me we had such a good piece of fun the other day at colonel forster s kitty and me were to spend the day there and mrs forster promised to have a little dance in the evening by the bye mrs forster and me are such friends and so she asked the two harringtons to come but harriet was ill and so pen was forced to come by herself and then what do you think we did we dressed up chamberlayne in woman s clothes on purpose to pass for a lady only think what fun not a soul knew of it but colonel and mrs forster and kitty and me except my aunt for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns and you cannot imagine how well he looked when denny and wickham and pratt and two or three more of the men came in they did not know him in the least lord how i laughed and so did mrs forster i thought i should have died and that made the men suspect something and then they soon found out what was the matter with such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes did lydia assisted by kitty s hints and additions endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to longbourn elizabeth listened as little as she could but there was no escaping the frequent mention of wickham s name their reception at home was most kind mrs bennet rejoiced to see jane in undiminished beauty and more than once during dinner did mr bennet say voluntarily to elizabeth i am glad you are come back lizzy their party in the dining room was large for almost all the lucases came to meet maria and hear the news and various were the subjects which occupied them lady lucas was inquiring of maria across the table after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter mrs bennet was doubly engaged on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from jane who sat some way below her and on the other retailing them all to the younger miss lucases and lydia in a voice rather louder than any other person s was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to anybody who would hear her oh mary said she i wish you had gone with us for we had such fun as we went along kitty and me drew up all the blinds and pretended there was nobody in the coach and i should have gone so all the way if kitty had not been sick and when we got to the george i do think we behaved very handsomely for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world and if you would have gone we would have treated you too and then when we came away it was such fun i thought we never should have got into the coach i was ready to die of laughter and then we were so merry all the way home we talked and laughed so loud that anybody might have heard us ten miles off to this mary very gravely replied far be it from me my dear sister to depreciate such pleasures they would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds but i confess they would have no charms for me i should infinitely prefer a book but of this answer lydia heard not a word she seldom listened to anybody for more than half a minute and never attended to mary at all in the afternoon lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to meryton and see how everybody went on but elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme it should not be said that the miss bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers there was another reason too for her opposition she dreaded seeing wickham again and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible the comfort to her of the regiment s approaching removal was indeed beyond expression in a fortnight they were to go and once gone she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account she had not been many hours at home before she found that the brighton scheme of which lydia had given them a hint at the inn was under frequent discussion between her parents elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal that her mother though often disheartened had never yet despaired of succeeding at last illustration chapter xl illustration elizabeth s impatience to acquaint jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned and preparing her to be surprised she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between mr darcy and herself miss bennet s astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of elizabeth appear perfectly natural and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings she was sorry that mr darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister s refusal must have given him his being so sure of succeeding was wrong said she and certainly ought not to have appeared but consider how much it must increase his disappointment indeed replied elizabeth i am heartily sorry for him but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me you do not blame me however for refusing him blame you oh no but you blame me for having spoken so warmly of wickham no i do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did but you will know it when i have told you what happened the very next day she then spoke of the letter repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned george wickham what a stroke was this for poor jane who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind as was here collected in one individual nor was darcy s vindication though grateful to her feelings capable of consoling her for such discovery most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error and seek to clear one without involving the other this will not do said elizabeth you never will be able to make both of them good for anything take your choice but you must be satisfied with only one there is but such a quantity of merit between them just enough to make one good sort of man and of late it has been shifting about pretty much for my part i am inclined to believe it all mr darcy s but you shall do as you choose it was some time however before a smile could be extorted from jane i do not know when i have been more shocked said she wickham so very bad it is almost past belief and poor mr darcy dear lizzy only consider what he must have suffered such a disappointment and with the knowledge of your ill opinion too and having to relate such a thing of his sister it is really too distressing i am sure you must feel it so oh no my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both i know you will do him such ample justice that i am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent your profusion makes me saving and if you lament over him much longer my heart will be as light as a feather poor wickham there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance such an openness and gentleness in his manner there certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men one has got all the goodness and the other all the appearance of it i never thought mr darcy so deficient in the appearance of it as you used to do and yet i meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him without any reason it is such a spur to one s genius such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind one may be continually abusive without saying anything just but one cannot be always laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty lizzy when you first read that letter i am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now indeed i could not i was uncomfortable enough i was very uncomfortable i may say unhappy and with no one to speak to of what i felt no jane to comfort me and say that i had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as i knew i had oh how i wanted you how unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of wickham to mr darcy for now they do appear wholly undeserved certainly but the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most natural consequence of the prejudices i had been encouraging there is one point on which i want your advice i want to be told whether i ought or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand wickham s character miss bennet paused a little and then replied surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully what is your own opinion that it ought not to be attempted mr darcy has not authorized me to make his communication public on the contrary every particular relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself and if i endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct who will believe me the general prejudice against mr darcy is so violent that it would be the death of half the good people in meryton to attempt to place him in an amiable light i am not equal to it wickham will soon be gone and therefore it will not signify to anybody here what he really is some time hence it will be all found out and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before at present i will say nothing about it you are quite right to have his errors made public might ruin him for ever he is now perhaps sorry for what he has done and anxious to re establish a character we must not make him desperate the tumult of elizabeth s mind was allayed by this conversation she had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight and was certain of a willing listener in jane whenever she might wish to talk again of either but there was still something lurking behind of which prudence forbade the disclosure she dared not relate the other half of mr darcy s letter nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by his friend here was knowledge in which no one could partake and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last encumbrance of mystery and then said she if that very improbable event should ever take place i shall merely be able to tell what bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself the liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value she was now on being settled at home at leisure to observe the real state of her sister s spirits jane was not happy she still cherished a very tender affection for bingley having never even fancied herself in love before her regard had all the warmth of first attachment and from her age and disposition greater steadiness than first attachments often boast and so fervently did she value his remembrance and prefer him to every other man that all her good sense and all her attention to the feelings of her friends were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity well lizzy said mrs bennet one day what is your opinion now of this sad business of jane s for my part i am determined never to speak of it again to anybody i told my sister philips so the other day but i cannot find out that jane saw anything of him in london well he is a very undeserving young man and i do not suppose there is the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now there is no talk of his coming to netherfield again in the summer and i have inquired of everybody too who is likely to know illustration i am determined never to speak of it again i do not believe that he will ever live at netherfield any more oh well it is just as he chooses nobody wants him to come though i shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill and if i was her i would not have put up with it well my comfort is i am sure jane will die of a broken heart and then he will be sorry for what he has done but as elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation she made no answer well lizzy continued her mother soon afterwards and so the collinses live very comfortable do they well well i only hope it will last and what sort of table do they keep charlotte is an excellent manager i dare say if she is half as sharp as her mother she is saving enough there is nothing extravagant in their housekeeping i dare say no nothing at all a great deal of good management depend upon it yes yes they will take care not to outrun their income they will never be distressed for money well much good may it do them and so i suppose they often talk of having longbourn when your father is dead they look upon it quite as their own i dare say whenever that happens it was a subject which they could not mention before me no it would have been strange if they had but i make no doubt they often talk of it between themselves well if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own so much the better i should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me illustration when colonel miller s regiment went away copyright by george allen chapter xli illustration the first week of their return was soon gone the second began it was the last of the regiment s stay in meryton and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace the dejection was almost universal the elder miss bennets alone were still able to eat drink and sleep and pursue the usual course of their employments very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by kitty and lydia whose own misery was extreme and who could not comprehend such hard heartedness in any of the family good heaven what is to become of us what are we to do would they often exclaim in the bitterness of woe how can you be smiling so lizzy their affectionate mother shared all their grief she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion five and twenty years ago i am sure said she i cried for two days together when colonel miller s regiment went away i thought i should have broke my heart i am sure i shall break mine said lydia if one could but go to brighton observed mrs bennet oh yes if one could but go to brighton but papa is so disagreeable a little sea bathing would set me up for ever and my aunt philips is sure it would do me a great deal of good added kitty such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through longbourn house elizabeth tried to be diverted by them but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame she felt anew the justice of mr darcy s objections and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend but the gloom of lydia s prospect was shortly cleared away for she received an invitation from mrs forster the wife of the colonel of the regiment to accompany her to brighton this invaluable friend was a very young woman and very lately married a resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and lydia to each other and out of their three months acquaintance they had been intimate two the rapture of lydia on this occasion her adoration of mrs forster the delight of mrs bennet and the mortification of kitty are scarcely to be described wholly inattentive to her sister s feelings lydia flew about the house in restless ecstasy calling for everyone s congratulations and laughing and talking with more violence than ever whilst the luckless kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish i cannot see why mrs forster should not ask me as well as lydia said she though i am not her particular friend i have just as much right to be asked as she has and more too for i am two years older in vain did elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable and jane to make her resigned as for elizabeth herself this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and lydia that she considered it as the death warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter and detestable as such a step must make her were it known she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go she represented to him all the improprieties of lydia s general behaviour the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as mrs forster and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at brighton where the temptations must be greater than at home he heard her attentively and then said lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances if you were aware said elizabeth of the very great disadvantage to us all which must arise from the public notice of lydia s unguarded and imprudent manner nay which has already arisen from it i am sure you would judge differently in the affair already arisen repeated mr bennet what has she frightened away some of your lovers poor little lizzy but do not be cast down such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity are not worth a regret come let me see the list of the pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by lydia s folly indeed you are mistaken i have no such injuries to resent it is not of peculiar but of general evils which i am now complaining our importance our respectability in the world must be affected by the wild volatility the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark lydia s character excuse me for i must speak plainly if you my dear father will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment her character will be fixed and she will at sixteen be the most determined flirt that ever made herself and her family ridiculous a flirt too in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person and from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite in this danger kitty is also comprehended she will follow wherever lydia leads vain ignorant idle and absolutely uncontrolled oh my dear father can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace mr bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject and affectionately taking her hand said in reply do not make yourself uneasy my love wherever you and jane are known you must be respected and valued and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of or i may say three very silly sisters we shall have no peace at longbourn if lydia does not go to brighton let her go then colonel forster is a sensible man and will keep her out of any real mischief and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to anybody at brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here the officers will find women better worth their notice let us hope therefore that her being there may teach her her own insignificance at any rate she cannot grow many degrees worse without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest of her life with this answer elizabeth was forced to be content but her own opinion continued the same and she left him disappointed and sorry it was not in her nature however to increase her vexations by dwelling on them she was confident of having performed her duty and to fret over unavoidable evils or augment them by anxiety was no part of her disposition had lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united volubility in lydia s imagination a visit to brighton comprised every possibility of earthly happiness she saw with the creative eye of fancy the streets of that gay bathing place covered with officers she saw herself the object of attention to tens and to scores of them at present unknown she saw all the glories of the camp its tents stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines crowded with the young and the gay and dazzling with scarlet and to complete the view she saw herself seated beneath a tent tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once illustration tenderly flirting copyright by george allen had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such realities as these what would have been her sensations they could have been understood only by her mother who might have felt nearly the same lydia s going to brighton was all that consoled her for the melancholy conviction of her husband s never intending to go there himself but they were entirely ignorant of what had passed and their raptures continued with little intermission to the very day of lydia s leaving home elizabeth was now to see mr wickham for the last time having been frequently in company with him since her return agitation was pretty well over the agitations of former partiality entirely so she had even learnt to detect in the very gentleness which had first delighted her an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary in his present behaviour to herself moreover she had a fresh source of displeasure for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve after what had since passed to provoke her she lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry and while she steadily repressed it could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing that however long and for whatever cause his attentions had been withdrawn her vanity would be gratified and her preference secured at any time by their renewal on the very last day of the regiment s remaining in meryton he dined with others of the officers at longbourn and so little was elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour that on his making some inquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at hunsford she mentioned colonel fitzwilliam s and mr darcy s having both spent three weeks at rosings and asked him if he were acquainted with the former he looked surprised displeased alarmed but with a moment s recollection and a returning smile replied that he had formerly seen him often and after observing that he was a very gentlemanlike man asked her how she had liked him her answer was warmly in his favour with an air of indifference he soon afterwards added how long did you say that he was at rosings nearly three weeks and you saw him frequently yes almost every day his manners are very different from his cousin s yes very different but i think mr darcy improves on acquaintance indeed cried wickham with a look which did not escape her and pray may i ask but checking himself he added in a gayer tone is it in address that he improves has he deigned to add aught of civility to his ordinary style for i dare not hope he continued in a lower and more serious tone that he is improved in essentials oh no said elizabeth in essentials i believe he is very much what he ever was while she spoke wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her words or to distrust their meaning there was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention while she added when i said that he improved on acquaintance i did not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement but that from knowing him better his disposition was better understood wickham s alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look for a few minutes he was silent till shaking off his embarrassment he turned to her again and said in the gentlest of accents you who so well know my feelings towards mr darcy will readily comprehend how sincerely i must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the appearance of what is right his pride in that direction may be of service if not to himself to many others for it must deter him from such foul misconduct as i have suffered by i only fear that the sort of cautiousness to which you i imagine have been alluding is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt of whose good opinion and judgment he stands much in awe his fear of her has always operated i know when they were together and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with miss de bourgh which i am certain he has very much at heart elizabeth could not repress a smile at this but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head she saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances and she was in no humour to indulge him the rest of the evening passed with the appearance on his side of usual cheerfulness but with no further attempt to distinguish elizabeth and they parted at last with mutual civility and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again when the party broke up lydia returned with mrs forster to meryton from whence they were to set out early the next morning the separation between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic kitty was the only one who shed tears but she did weep from vexation and envy mrs bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible advice which there was every reason to believe would be attended to and in the clamorous happiness of lydia herself in bidding farewell the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard illustration the arrival of the gardiners chapter xlii illustration had elizabeth s opinion been all drawn from her own family she could not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort her father captivated by youth and beauty and that appearance of good humour which youth and beauty generally give had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her respect esteem and confidence had vanished for ever and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown but mr bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice he was fond of the country and of books and from these tastes had arisen his principal enjoyments to his wife he was very little otherwise indebted than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement this is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife but where other powers of entertainment are wanting the true philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given elizabeth however had never been blind to the impropriety of her father s behaviour as a husband she had always seen it with pain but respecting his abilities and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children was so highly reprehensible but she had never felt so strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill judged a direction of talents talents which rightly used might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife when elizabeth had rejoiced over wickham s departure she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment their parties abroad were less varied than before and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at the dulness of everything around them threw a real gloom over their domestic circle and though kitty might in time regain her natural degree of sense since the disturbers of her brain were removed her other sister from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance by a situation of such double danger as a watering place and a camp upon the whole therefore she found what has been sometimes found before that an event to which she had looked forward with impatient desire did not in taking place bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself it was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity to have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation console herself for the present and prepare for another disappointment her tour to the lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her mother and kitty made inevitable and could she have included jane in the scheme every part of it would have been perfect but it is fortunate thought she that i have something to wish for were the whole arrangement complete my disappointment would be certain but here by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sister s absence i may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realized a scheme of which every part promises delight can never be successful and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation when lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother and kitty but her letters were always long expected and always very short those to her mother contained little else than that they were just returned from the library where such and such officers had attended them and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild that she had a new gown or a new parasol which she would have described more fully but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry as mrs forster called her and they were going to the camp and from her correspondence with her sister there was still less to be learnt for her letters to kitty though rather longer were much too full of lines under the words to be made public after the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence health good humour and cheerfulness began to reappear at longbourn everything wore a happier aspect the families who had been in town for the winter came back again and summer finery and summer engagements arose mrs bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity and by the middle of june kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter meryton without tears an event of such happy promise as to make elizabeth hope that by the following christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day unless by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the war office another regiment should be quartered in meryton the time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast approaching and a fortnight only was wanting of it when a letter arrived from mrs gardiner which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its extent mr gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in july and must be in london again within a month and as that left too short a period for them to go so far and see so much as they had proposed or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on they were obliged to give up the lakes and substitute a more contracted tour and according to the present plan were to go no farther northward than derbyshire in that county there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three weeks and to mrs gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction the town where she had formerly passed some years of her life and where they were now to spend a few days was probably as great an object of her curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of matlock chatsworth dovedale or the peak elizabeth was excessively disappointed she had set her heart on seeing the lakes and still thought there might have been time enough but it was her business to be satisfied and certainly her temper to be happy and all was soon right again with the mention of derbyshire there were many ideas connected it was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of pemberley and its owner but surely said she i may enter his county with impunity and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me the period of expectation was now doubled four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunt s arrival but they did pass away and mr and mrs gardiner with their four children did at length appear at longbourn the children two girls of six and eight years old and two younger boys were to be left under the particular care of their cousin jane who was the general favourite and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every way teaching them playing with them and loving them the gardiners stayed only one night at longbourn and set off the next morning with elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement one enjoyment was certain that of suitableness as companions a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniences cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure and affection and intelligence which might supply it among themselves if there were disappointments abroad it is not the object of this work to give a description of derbyshire nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither lay oxford blenheim warwick kenilworth birmingham etc are sufficiently known a small part of derbyshire is all the present concern to the little town of lambton the scene of mrs gardiner s former residence and where she had lately learned that some acquaintance still remained they bent their steps after having seen all the principal wonders of the country and within five miles of lambton elizabeth found from her aunt that pemberley was situated it was not in their direct road nor more than a mile or two out of it in talking over their route the evening before mrs gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again mr gardiner declared his willingness and elizabeth was applied to for her approbation my love should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much said her aunt a place too with which so many of your acquaintance are connected wickham passed all his youth there you know elizabeth was distressed she felt that she had no business at pemberley and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it she must own that she was tired of great houses after going over so many she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains mrs gardiner abused her stupidity if it were merely a fine house richly furnished said she i should not care about it myself but the grounds are delightful they have some of the finest woods in the country elizabeth said no more but her mind could not acquiesce the possibility of meeting mr darcy while viewing the place instantly occurred it would be dreadful she blushed at the very idea and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt than to run such a risk but against this there were objections and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource if her private inquiries as to the absence of the family were unfavourably answered accordingly when she retired at night she asked the chambermaid whether pemberley were not a very fine place what was the name of its proprietor and with no little alarm whether the family were down for the summer a most welcome negative followed the last question and her alarms being now removed she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself and when the subject was revived the next morning and she was again applied to could readily answer and with a proper air of indifference that she had not really any dislike to the scheme to pemberley therefore they were to go illustration conjecturing as to the date chapter xliii illustration elizabeth as they drove along watched for the first appearance of pemberley woods with some perturbation and when at length they turned in at the lodge her spirits were in a high flutter the park was very large and contained great variety of ground they entered it in one of its lowest points and drove for some time through a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent elizabeth s mind was too full for conversation but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view they gradually ascended for half a mile and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminence where the wood ceased and the eye was instantly caught by pemberley house situated on the opposite side of the valley into which the road with some abruptness wound it was a large handsome stone building standing well on rising ground and backed by a ridge of high woody hills and in front a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater but without any artificial appearance its banks were neither formal nor falsely adorned elizabeth was delighted she had never seen a place for which nature had done more or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste they were all of them warm in their admiration and at that moment she felt that to be mistress of pemberley might be something they descended the hill crossed the bridge and drove to the door and while examining the nearer aspect of the house all her apprehension of meeting its owner returned she dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken on applying to see the place they were admitted into the hall and elizabeth as they waited for the housekeeper had leisure to wonder at her being where she was the housekeeper came a respectable looking elderly woman much less fine and more civil than she had any notion of finding her they followed her into the dining parlour it was a large well proportioned room handsomely fitted up elizabeth after slightly surveying it went to a window to enjoy its prospect the hill crowned with wood from which they had descended receiving increased abruptness from the distance was a beautiful object every disposition of the ground was good and she looked on the whole scene the river the trees scattered on its banks and the winding of the valley as far as she could trace it with delight as they passed into other rooms these objects were taking different positions but from every window there were beauties to be seen the rooms were lofty and handsome and their furniture suitable to the fortune of their proprietor but elizabeth saw with admiration of his taste that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine with less of splendour and more real elegance than the furniture of rosings and of this place thought she i might have been mistress with these rooms i might have now been familiarly acquainted instead of viewing them as a stranger i might have rejoiced in them as my own and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt but no recollecting herself that could never be my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me i should not have been allowed to invite them this was a lucky recollection it saved her from something like regret she longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her master were really absent but had not courage for it at length however the question was asked by her uncle and she turned away with alarm while mrs reynolds replied that he was adding but we expect him to morrow with a large party of friends how rejoiced was elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day her aunt now called her to look at a picture she approached and saw the likeness of mr wickham suspended amongst several other miniatures over the mantel piece her aunt asked her smilingly how she liked it the housekeeper came forward and told them it was the picture of a young gentleman the son of her late master s steward who had been brought up by him at his own expense he is now gone into the army she added but i am afraid he has turned out very wild mrs gardiner looked at her niece with a smile but elizabeth could not return it and that said mrs reynolds pointing to another of the miniatures is my master and very like him it was drawn at the same time as the other about eight years ago i have heard much of your master s fine person said mrs gardiner looking at the picture it is a handsome face but lizzy you can tell us whether it is like or not mrs reynolds respect for elizabeth seemed to increase on this intimation of her knowing her master does that young lady know mr darcy elizabeth coloured and said a little and do not you think him a very handsome gentleman ma am yes very handsome i am sure i know none so handsome but in the gallery upstairs you will see a finer larger picture of him than this this room was my late master s favourite room and these miniatures are just as they used to be then he was very fond of them this accounted to elizabeth for mr wickham s being among them mrs reynolds then directed their attention to one of miss darcy drawn when she was only eight years old and is miss darcy as handsome as her brother said mr gardiner oh yes the handsomest young lady that ever was seen and so accomplished she plays and sings all day long in the next room is a new instrument just come down for her a present from my master she comes here to morrow with him mr gardiner whose manners were easy and pleasant encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks mrs reynolds either from pride or attachment had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister is your master much at pemberley in the course of the year not so much as i could wish sir but i dare say he may spend half his time here and miss darcy is always down for the summer months except thought elizabeth when she goes to ramsgate if your master would marry you might see more of him yes sir but i do not know when that will be i do not know who is good enough for him mr and mrs gardiner smiled elizabeth could not help saying it is very much to his credit i am sure that you should think so i say no more than the truth and what everybody will say that knows him replied the other elizabeth thought this was going pretty far and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added i have never had a cross word from him in my life and i have known him ever since he was four years old this was praise of all others most extraordinary most opposite to her ideas that he was not a good tempered man had been her firmest opinion her keenest attention was awakened she longed to hear more and was grateful to her uncle for saying there are very few people of whom so much can be said you are lucky in having such a master yes sir i know i am if i were to go through the world i could not meet with a better but i have always observed that they who are good natured when children are good natured when they grow up and he was always the sweetest tempered most generous hearted boy in the world elizabeth almost stared at her can this be mr darcy thought she his father was an excellent man said mrs gardiner yes ma am that he was indeed and his son will be just like him just as affable to the poor elizabeth listened wondered doubted and was impatient for more mrs reynolds could interest her on no other point she related the subjects of the pictures the dimensions of the rooms and the price of the furniture in vain mr gardiner highly amused by the kind of family prejudice to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master soon led again to the subject and she dwelt with energy on his many merits as they proceeded together up the great staircase he is the best landlord and the best master said she that ever lived not like the wild young men now a days who think of nothing but themselves there is not one of his tenants or servants but what will give him a good name some people call him proud but i am sure i never saw anything of it to my fancy it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men in what an amiable light does this place him thought elizabeth this fine account of him whispered her aunt as they walked is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend perhaps we might be deceived that is not very likely our authority was too good on reaching the spacious lobby above they were shown into a very pretty sitting room lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below and were informed that it was but just done to give pleasure to miss darcy who had taken a liking to the room when last at pemberley he is certainly a good brother said elizabeth as she walked towards one of the windows mrs reynolds anticipated miss darcy s delight when she should enter the room and this is always the way with him she added whatever can give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in a moment there is nothing he would not do for her the picture gallery and two or three of the principal bed rooms were all that remained to be shown in the former were many good paintings but elizabeth knew nothing of the art and from such as had been already visible below she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of miss darcy s in crayons whose subjects were usually more interesting and also more intelligible in the gallery there were many family portraits but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger elizabeth walked on in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her at last it arrested her and she beheld a striking resemblance of mr darcy with such a smile over the face as she remembered to have sometimes seen when he looked at her she stood several minutes before the picture in earnest contemplation and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery mrs reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his father s lifetime there was certainly at this moment in elizabeth s mind a more gentle sensation towards the original than she had ever felt in the height of their acquaintance the commendation bestowed on him by mrs reynolds was of no trifling nature what praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant as a brother a landlord a master she considered how many people s happiness were in his guardianship how much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow how much of good or evil must be done by him every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character and as she stood before the canvas on which he was represented and fixed his eyes upon herself she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before she remembered its warmth and softened its impropriety of expression when all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen they returned down stairs and taking leave of the housekeeper were consigned over to the gardener who met them at the hall door as they walked across the lawn towards the river elizabeth turned back to look again her uncle and aunt stopped also and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road which led behind it to the stables they were within twenty yards of each other and so abrupt was his appearance that it was impossible to avoid his sight their eyes instantly met and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest blush he absolutely started and for a moment seemed immovable from surprise but shortly recovering himself advanced towards the party and spoke to elizabeth if not in terms of perfect composure at least of perfect civility she had instinctively turned away but stopping on his approach received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome had his first appearance or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw mr darcy the gardener s expression of surprise on beholding his master must immediately have told it they stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece who astonished and confused scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face and knew not what answer she returned to his civil inquiries after her family amazed at the alteration of his manner since they last parted every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind the few minutes in which they continued together were some of the most uncomfortable of her life nor did he seem much more at ease when he spoke his accent had none of its usual sedateness and he repeated his inquiries as to the time of her having left longbourn and of her stay in derbyshire so often and in so hurried a way as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts at length every idea seemed to fail him and after standing a few moments without saying a word he suddenly recollected himself and took leave the others then joined her and expressed their admiration of his figure but elizabeth heard not a word and wholly engrossed by her own feelings followed them in silence she was overpowered by shame and vexation her coming there was the most unfortunate the most ill judged thing in the world how strange must it appear to him in what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man it might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again oh why did she come or why did he thus come a day before he was expected had they been only ten minutes sooner they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination for it was plain that he was that moment arrived that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage she blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting and his behaviour so strikingly altered what could it mean that he should even speak to her was amazing but to speak with such civility to inquire after her family never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting what a contrast did it offer to his last address in rosings park when he put his letter into her hand she knew not what to think or how to account for it they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching but it was some time before elizabeth was sensible of any of it and though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out she distinguished no part of the scene her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of pemberley house whichever it might be where mr darcy then was she longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind in what manner he thought of her and whether in defiance of everything she was still dear to him perhaps he had been civil only because he felt himself at ease yet there had been that in his voice which was not like ease whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her she could not tell but he certainly had not seen her with composure at length however the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself they entered the woods and bidding adieu to the river for a while ascended some of the higher grounds whence in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander were many charming views of the valley the opposite hills with the long range of woods overspreading many and occasionally part of the stream mr gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole park but feared it might be beyond a walk with a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten miles round it settled the matter and they pursued the accustomed circuit which brought them again after some time in a descent among hanging woods to the edge of the water and one of its narrowest parts they crossed it by a simple bridge in character with the general air of the scene it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited and the valley here contracted into a glen allowed room only for the stream and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice wood which bordered it elizabeth longed to explore its windings but when they had crossed the bridge and perceived their distance from the house mrs gardiner who was not a great walker could go no farther and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible her niece was therefore obliged to submit and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river in the nearest direction but their progress was slow for mr gardiner though seldom able to indulge the taste was very fond of fishing and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water and talking to the man about them that he advanced but little whilst wandering on in this slow manner they were again surprised and elizabeth s astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first by the sight of mr darcy approaching them and at no great distance the walk being here less sheltered than on the other side allowed them to see him before they met elizabeth however astonished was at least more prepared for an interview than before and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness if he really intended to meet them for a few moments indeed she felt that he would probably strike into some other path the idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view the turning past he was immediately before them with a glance she saw that he had lost none of his recent civility and to imitate his politeness she began as they met to admire the beauty of the place but she had not got beyond the words delightful and charming when some unlucky recollections obtruded and she fancied that praise of pemberley from her might be mischievously construed her colour changed and she said no more mrs gardiner was standing a little behind and on her pausing he asked her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends this was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared and she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people against whom his pride had revolted in his offer to herself what will be his surprise thought she when he knows who they are he takes them now for people of fashion the introduction however was immediately made and as she named their relationship to herself she stole a sly look at him to see how he bore it and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions that he was surprised by the connection was evident he sustained it however with fortitude and so far from going away turned back with them and entered into conversation with mr gardiner elizabeth could not but be pleased could not but triumph it was consoling that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush she listened most attentively to all that passed between them and gloried in every expression every sentence of her uncle which marked his intelligence his taste or his good manners the conversation soon turned upon fishing and she heard mr darcy invite him with the greatest civility to fish there as often as he chose while he continued in the neighbourhood offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport mrs gardiner who was walking arm in arm with elizabeth gave her a look expressive of her wonder elizabeth said nothing but it gratified her exceedingly the compliment must be all for herself her astonishment however was extreme and continually was she repeating why is he so altered from what can it proceed it cannot be for me it cannot be for my sake that his manners are thus softened my reproofs at hunsford could not work such a change as this it is impossible that he should still love me after walking some time in this way the two ladies in front the two gentlemen behind on resuming their places after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water plant there chanced to be a little alteration it originated in mrs gardiner who fatigued by the exercise of the morning found elizabeth s arm inadequate to her support and consequently preferred her husband s mr darcy took her place by her niece and they walked on together after a short silence the lady first spoke she wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place and accordingly began by observing that his arrival had been very unexpected for your housekeeper she added informed us that you would certainly not be here till to morrow and indeed before we left bakewell we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country he acknowledged the truth of it all and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling they will join me early to morrow he continued and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you mr bingley and his sisters elizabeth answered only by a slight bow her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when mr bingley s name had been last mentioned between them and if she might judge from his complexion his mind was not very differently engaged there is also one other person in the party he continued after a pause who more particularly wishes to be known to you will you allow me or do i ask too much to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at lambton the surprise of such an application was great indeed it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it she immediately felt that whatever desire miss darcy might have of being acquainted with her must be the work of her brother and without looking farther it was satisfactory it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her they now walked on in silence each of them deep in thought elizabeth was not comfortable that was impossible but she was flattered and pleased his wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of the highest kind they soon outstripped the others and when they had reached the carriage mr and mrs gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind he then asked her to walk into the house but she declared herself not tired and they stood together on the lawn at such a time much might have been said and silence was very awkward she wanted to talk but there seemed an embargo on every subject at last she recollected that she had been travelling and they talked of matlock and dovedale with great perseverance yet time and her aunt moved slowly and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the t te t te was over on mr and mrs gardiner s coming up they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment but this was declined and they parted on each side with the utmost politeness mr darcy handed the ladies into the carriage and when it drove off elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house the observations of her uncle and aunt now began and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they had expected he is perfectly well behaved polite and unassuming said her uncle there is something a little stately in him to be sure replied her aunt but it is confined to his air and is not unbecoming i can now say with the housekeeper that though some people may call him proud i have seen nothing of it i was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us it was more than civil it was really attentive and there was no necessity for such attention his acquaintance with elizabeth was very trifling to be sure lizzy said her aunt he is not so handsome as wickham or rather he has not wickham s countenance for his features are perfectly good but how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable elizabeth excused herself as well as she could said that she had liked him better when they met in kent than before and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning but perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities replied her uncle your great men often are and therefore i shall not take him at his word about fishing as he might change his mind another day and warn me off his grounds elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character but said nothing from what we have seen of him continued mrs gardiner i really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by anybody as he has done by poor wickham he has not an ill natured look on the contrary there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks and there is something of dignity in his countenance that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart but to be sure the good lady who showed us the house did give him a most flaming character i could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes but he is a liberal master i suppose and that in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to wickham and therefore gave them to understand in as guarded a manner as she could that by what she had heard from his relations in kent his actions were capable of a very different construction and that his character was by no means so faulty nor wickham s so amiable as they had been considered in hertfordshire in confirmation of this she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected without actually naming her authority but stating it to be such as might be relied on mrs gardiner was surprised and concerned but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures every idea gave way to the charm of recollection and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs to think of anything else fatigued as she had been by the morning s walk they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an intercourse renewed after many years discontinuance the occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends and she could do nothing but think and think with wonder of mr darcy s civility and above all of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister illustration chapter xliv illustration elizabeth had settled it that mr darcy would bring his sister to visit her the very day after her reaching pemberley and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning but her conclusion was false for on the very morning after their own arrival at lambton these visitors came they had been walking about the place with some of their new friends and were just returned to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window and they saw a gentleman and lady in a curricle driving up the street elizabeth immediately recognizing the livery guessed what it meant and imparted no small degree of surprise to her relations by acquainting them with the honour which she expected her uncle and aunt were all amazement and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke joined to the circumstance itself and many of the circumstances of the preceding day opened to them a new idea on the business nothing had ever suggested it before but they now felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece while these newly born notions were passing in their heads the perturbation of elizabeth s feelings was every moment increasing she was quite amazed at her own discomposure but amongst other causes of disquiet she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour and more than commonly anxious to please she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her she retreated from the window fearful of being seen and as she walked up and down the room endeavouring to compose herself saw such looks of inquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made everything worse miss darcy and her brother appeared and this formidable introduction took place with astonishment did elizabeth see that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself since her being at lambton she had heard that miss darcy was exceedingly proud but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was only exceedingly shy she found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable miss darcy was tall and on a larger scale than elizabeth and though little more than sixteen her figure was formed and her appearance womanly and graceful she was less handsome than her brother but there was sense and good humour in her face and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle elizabeth who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever mr darcy had been was much relieved by discerning such different feelings they had not been long together before darcy told her that bingley was also coming to wait on her and she had barely time to express her satisfaction and prepare for such a visitor when bingley s quick step was heard on the stairs and in a moment he entered the room all elizabeth s anger against him had been long done away but had she still felt any it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again he inquired in a friendly though general way after her family and looked and spoke with the same good humoured ease that he had ever done to mr and mrs gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herself they had long wished to see him the whole party before them indeed excited a lively attention the suspicions which had just arisen of mr darcy and their niece directed their observation towards each with an earnest though guarded inquiry and they soon drew from those inquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love of the lady s sensations they remained a little in doubt but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough elizabeth on her side had much to do she wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors she wanted to compose her own and to make herself agreeable to all and in the latter object where she feared most to fail she was most sure of success for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were pre possessed in her favour bingley was ready georgiana was eager and darcy determined to be pleased illustration to make herself agreeable to all copyright by george allen in seeing bingley her thoughts naturally flew to her sister and oh how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in a like manner sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on former occasions and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that as he looked at her he was trying to trace a resemblance but though this might be imaginary she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to miss darcy who had been set up as a rival to jane no look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister on this point she was soon satisfied and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted which in her anxious interpretation denoted a recollection of jane not untinctured by tenderness and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her had he dared he observed to her at a moment when the others were talking together and in a tone which had something of real regret that it was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her and before she could reply he added it is above eight months we have not met since the th of november when we were all dancing together at netherfield elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact and he afterwards took occasion to ask her when unattended to by any of the rest whether all her sisters were at longbourn there was not much in the question nor in the preceding remark but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning it was not often that she could turn her eyes on mr darcy himself but whenever she did catch a glimpse she saw an expression of general complaisance and in all that he said she heard an accent so far removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed however temporary its existence might prove had at least outlived one day when she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace when she saw him thus civil not only to herself but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained and recollected their last lively scene in hunsford parsonage the difference the change was so great and struck so forcibly on her mind that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible never even in the company of his dear friends at netherfield or his dignified relations at rosings had she seen him so desirous to please so free from self consequence or unbending reserve as now when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of netherfield and rosings their visitors stayed with them above half an hour and when they arose to depart mr darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing mr and mrs gardiner and miss bennet to dinner at pemberley before they left the country miss darcy though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations readily obeyed mrs gardiner looked at her niece desirous of knowing how she whom the invitation most concerned felt disposed as to its acceptance but elizabeth had turned away her head presuming however that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than any dislike of the proposal and seeing in her husband who was fond of society a perfect willingness to accept it she ventured to engage for her attendance and the day after the next was fixed on bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing elizabeth again having still a great deal to say to her and many inquiries to make after all their hertfordshire friends elizabeth construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister was pleased and on this account as well as some others found herself when their visitors left them capable of considering the last half hour with some satisfaction though while it was passing the enjoyment of it had been little eager to be alone and fearful of inquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt she stayed with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of bingley and then hurried away to dress but she had no reason to fear mr and mrs gardiner s curiosity it was not their wish to force her communication it was evident that she was much better acquainted with mr darcy than they had before any idea of it was evident that he was very much in love with her they saw much to interest but nothing to justify inquiry of mr darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well and as far as their acquaintance reached there was no fault to find they could not be untouched by his politeness and had they drawn his character from their own feelings and his servant s report without any reference to any other account the circle in hertfordshire to which he was known would not have recognized it for mr darcy there was now an interest however in believing the housekeeper and they soon became sensible that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old and whose own manners indicated respectability was not to be hastily rejected neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of their lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight they had nothing to accuse him of but pride pride he probably had and if not it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market town where the family did not visit it was acknowledged however that he was a liberal man and did much good among the poor with respect to wickham the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation for though the chief of his concerns with the son of his patron were imperfectly understood it was yet a well known fact that on his quitting derbyshire he had left many debts behind him which mr darcy afterwards discharged as for elizabeth her thoughts were at pemberley this evening more than the last and the evening though as it passed it seemed long was not long enough to determine her feelings towards one in that mansion and she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out she certainly did not hate him no hatred had vanished long ago and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him that could be so called the respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities though at first unwillingly admitted had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature by the testimony so highly in his favour and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light which yesterday had produced but above all above respect and esteem there was a motive within her of good will which could not be overlooked it was gratitude gratitude not merely for having once loved her but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection he who she had been persuaded would avoid her as his greatest enemy seemed on this accidental meeting most eager to preserve the acquaintance and without any indelicate display of regard or any peculiarity of manner where their two selves only were concerned was soliciting the good opinion of her friends and bent on making her known to his sister such a change in a man of so much pride excited not only astonishment but gratitude for to love ardent love it must be attributed and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged as by no means unpleasing though it could not be exactly defined she respected she esteemed she was grateful to him she felt a real interest in his welfare and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power which her fancy told her she still possessed of bringing on the renewal of his addresses it had been settled in the evening between the aunt and niece that such a striking civility as miss darcy s in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at pemberley for she had reached it only to a late breakfast ought to be imitated though it could not be equalled by some exertion of politeness on their side and consequently that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at pemberley the following morning they were therefore to go elizabeth was pleased though when she asked herself the reason she had very little to say in reply mr gardiner left them soon after breakfast the fishing scheme had been renewed the day before and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at pemberley by noon illustration engaged by the river chapter xlv illustration convinced as elizabeth now was that miss bingley s dislike of her had originated in jealousy she could not help feeling how very unwelcome her appearance at pemberley must be to her and was curious to know with how much civility on that lady s side the acquaintance would now be renewed on reaching the house they were shown through the hall into the saloon whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer its windows opening to the ground admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house and of the beautiful oaks and spanish chestnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn in this room they were received by miss darcy who was sitting there with mrs hurst and miss bingley and the lady with whom she lived in london georgiana s reception of them was very civil but attended with all that embarrassment which though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior the belief of her being proud and reserved mrs gardiner and her niece however did her justice and pitied her by mrs hurst and miss bingley they were noticed only by a courtesy and on their being seated a pause awkward as such pauses must always be succeeded for a few moments it was first broken by mrs annesley a genteel agreeable looking woman whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the others and between her and mrs gardiner with occasional help from elizabeth the conversation was carried on miss darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it and sometimes did venture a short sentence when there was least danger of its being heard elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by miss bingley and that she could not speak a word especially to miss darcy without calling her attention this observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much her own thoughts were employing her she expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room she wished she feared that the master of the house might be amongst them and whether she wished or feared it most she could scarcely determine after sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing miss bingley s voice elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold inquiry after the health of her family she answered with equal indifference and brevity and the other said no more the next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat cake and a variety of all the finest fruits in season but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from mrs annesley to miss darcy had been given to remind her of her post there was now employment for the whole party for though they could not all talk they could all eat and the beautiful pyramids of grapes nectarines and peaches soon collected them round the table while thus engaged elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of mr darcy by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room and then though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate she began to regret that he came he had been some time with mr gardiner who with two or three other gentlemen from the house was engaged by the river and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to georgiana that morning no sooner did he appear than elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed a resolution the more necessary to be made but perhaps not the more easily kept because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room in no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in miss bingley s in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects for jealousy had not yet made her desperate and her attentions to mr darcy were by no means over miss darcy on her brother s entrance exerted herself much more to talk and elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted and forwarded as much as possible every attempt at conversation on either side miss bingley saw all this likewise and in the imprudence of anger took the first opportunity of saying with sneering civility pray miss eliza are not the shire militia removed from meryton they must be a great loss to your family in darcy s presence she dared not mention wickham s name but elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment s distress but exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill natured attack she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone while she spoke an involuntary glance showed her darcy with a heightened complexion earnestly looking at her and his sister overcome with confusion and unable to lift up her eyes had miss bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint but she had merely intended to discompose elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in darcy s opinion and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected with that corps not a syllable had ever reached her of miss darcy s meditated elopement to no creature had it been revealed where secrecy was possible except to elizabeth and from all bingley s connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it from that very wish which elizabeth had long ago attributed to him of their becoming hereafter her own he had certainly formed such a plan and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from miss bennet it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend elizabeth s collected behaviour however soon quieted his emotion and as miss bingley vexed and disappointed dared not approach nearer to wickham georgiana also recovered in time though not enough to be able to speak any more her brother whose eye she feared to meet scarcely recollected her interest in the affair and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from elizabeth seemed to have fixed them on her more and more cheerfully their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned and while mr darcy was attending them to their carriage miss bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on elizabeth s person behaviour and dress but georgiana would not join her her brother s recommendation was enough to insure her favour his judgment could not err and he had spoken in such terms of elizabeth as to leave georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable when darcy returned to the saloon miss bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister how very ill eliza bennet looks this morning mr darcy she cried i never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since the winter she is grown so brown and coarse louisa and i were agreeing that we should not have known her again however little mr darcy might have liked such an address he contented himself with coolly replying that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer for my own part she rejoined i must confess that i never could see any beauty in her her face is too thin her complexion has no brilliancy and her features are not at all handsome her nose wants character there is nothing marked in its lines her teeth are tolerable but not out of the common way and as for her eyes which have sometimes been called so fine i never could perceive anything extraordinary in them they have a sharp shrewish look which i do not like at all and in her air altogether there is a self sufficiency without fashion which is intolerable persuaded as miss bingley was that darcy admired elizabeth this was not the best method of recommending herself but angry people are not always wise and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled she had all the success she expected he was resolutely silent however and from a determination of making him speak she continued i remember when we first knew her in hertfordshire how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty and i particularly recollect your saying one night after they had been dining at netherfield she a beauty i should as soon call her mother a wit but afterwards she seemed to improve on you and i believe you thought her rather pretty at one time yes replied darcy who could contain himself no longer but that was only when i first knew her for it is many months since i have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance he then went away and miss bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself mrs gardiner and elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their visit as they returned except what had particularly interested them both the looks and behaviour of everybody they had seen were discussed except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention they talked of his sister his friends his house his fruit of everything but himself yet elizabeth was longing to know what mrs gardiner thought of him and mrs gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece s beginning the subject illustration chapter xlvi illustration elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from jane on their first arrival at lambton and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there but on the third her repining was over and her sister justified by the receipt of two letters from her at once on one of which was marked that it had been mis sent elsewhere elizabeth was not surprised at it as jane had written the direction remarkably ill they had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in and her uncle and aunt leaving her to enjoy them in quiet set off by themselves the one mis sent must be first attended to it had been written five days ago the beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements with such news as the country afforded but the latter half which was dated a day later and written in evident agitation gave more important intelligence it was to this effect since writing the above dearest lizzy something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature but i am afraid of alarming you be assured that we are all well what i have to say relates to poor lydia an express came at twelve last night just as we were all gone to bed from colonel forster to inform us that she was gone off to scotland with one of his officers to own the truth with wickham imagine our surprise to kitty however it does not seem so wholly unexpected i am very very sorry so imprudent a match on both sides but i am willing to hope the best and that his character has been misunderstood thoughtless and indiscreet i can easily believe him but this step and let us rejoice over it marks nothing bad at heart his choice is disinterested at least for he must know my father can give her nothing our poor mother is sadly grieved my father bears it better how thankful am i that we never let them know what has been said against him we must forget it ourselves they were off saturday night about twelve as is conjectured but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight the express was sent off directly my dear lizzy they must have passed within ten miles of us colonel forster gives us reason to expect him here soon lydia left a few lines for his wife informing her of their intention i must conclude for i cannot be long from my poor mother i am afraid you will not be able to make it out but i hardly know what i have written without allowing herself time for consideration and scarcely knowing what she felt elizabeth on finishing this letter instantly seized the other and opening it with the utmost impatience read as follows it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first by this time my dearest sister you have received my hurried letter i wish this may be more intelligible but though not confined for time my head is so bewildered that i cannot answer for being coherent dearest lizzy i hardly know what i would write but i have bad news for you and it cannot be delayed imprudent as a marriage between mr wickham and our poor lydia would be we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to scotland colonel forster came yesterday having left brighton the day before not many hours after the express though lydia s short letter to mrs f gave them to understand that they were going to gretna green something was dropped by denny expressing his belief that w never intended to go there or to marry lydia at all which was repeated to colonel f who instantly taking the alarm set off from b intending to trace their route he did trace them easily to clapham but no farther for on entering that place they removed into a hackney coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them from epsom all that is known after this is that they were seen to continue the london road i know not what to think after making every possible inquiry on that side of london colonel f came on into hertfordshire anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes and at the inns in barnet and hatfield but without any success no such people had been seen to pass through with the kindest concern he came on to longbourn and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart i am sincerely grieved for him and mrs f but no one can throw any blame on them our distress my dear lizzy is very great my father and mother believe the worst but i cannot think so ill of him many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan and even if he could form such a design against a young woman of lydia s connections which is not likely can i suppose her so lost to everything impossible i grieve to find however that colonel f is not disposed to depend upon their marriage he shook his head when i expressed my hopes and said he feared w was not a man to be trusted my poor mother is really ill and keeps her room could she exert herself it would be better but this is not to be expected and as to my father i never in my life saw him so affected poor kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot wonder i am truly glad dearest lizzy that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes but now as the first shock is over shall i own that i long for your return i am not so selfish however as to press for it if inconvenient adieu i take up my pen again to do what i have just told you i would not but circumstances are such that i cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here as soon as possible i know my dear uncle and aunt so well that i am not afraid of requesting it though i have still something more to ask of the former my father is going to london with colonel forster instantly to try to discover her what he means to do i am sure i know not but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest way and colonel forster is obliged to be at brighton again to morrow evening in such an exigence my uncle s advice and assistance would be everything in the world he will immediately comprehend what i must feel and i rely upon his goodness oh where where is my uncle cried elizabeth darting from her seat as she finished the letter in eagerness to follow him without losing a moment of the time so precious but as she reached the door it was opened by a servant and mr darcy appeared her pale face and impetuous manner made him start and before he could recover himself enough to speak she in whose mind every idea was superseded by lydia s situation hastily exclaimed i beg your pardon but i must leave you i must find mr gardiner this moment on business that cannot be delayed i have not an instant to lose good god what is the matter cried he with more feeling than politeness then recollecting himself i will not detain you a minute but let me or let the servant go after mr and mrs gardiner you are not well enough you cannot go yourself elizabeth hesitated but her knees trembled under her and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them calling back the servant therefore she commissioned him though in so breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible to fetch his master and mistress home instantly on his quitting the room she sat down unable to support herself and looking so miserably ill that it was impossible for darcy to leave her or to refrain from saying in a tone of gentleness and commiseration let me call your maid is there nothing you could take to give you present relief a glass of wine shall i get you one you are very ill no i thank you she replied endeavouring to recover herself there is nothing the matter with me i am quite well i am only distressed by some dreadful news which i have just received from longbourn she burst into tears as she alluded to it and for a few minutes could not speak another word darcy in wretched suspense could only say something indistinctly of his illustration i have not an instant to lose concern and observe her in compassionate silence at length she spoke again i have just had a letter from jane with such dreadful news it cannot be concealed from anyone my youngest sister has left all her friends has eloped has thrown herself into the power of of mr wickham they are gone off together from brighton you know him too well to doubt the rest she has no money no connections nothing that can tempt him to she is lost for ever darcy was fixed in astonishment when i consider she added in a yet more agitated voice that i might have prevented it i who knew what he was had i but explained some part of it only some part of what i learnt to my own family had his character been known this could not have happened but it is all all too late now i am grieved indeed cried darcy grieved shocked but is it certain absolutely certain oh yes they left brighton together on sunday night and were traced almost to london but not beyond they are certainly not gone to scotland and what has been done what has been attempted to recover her my father has gone to london and jane has written to beg my uncle s immediate assistance and we shall be off i hope in half an hour but nothing can be done i know very well that nothing can be done how is such a man to be worked on how are they even to be discovered i have not the smallest hope it is every way horrible darcy shook his head in silent acquiescence when my eyes were opened to his real character oh had i known what i ought what i dared to do but i knew not i was afraid of doing too much wretched wretched mistake darcy made no answer he seemed scarcely to hear her and was walking up and down the room in earnest meditation his brow contracted his air gloomy elizabeth soon observed and instantly understood it her power was sinking everything must sink under such a proof of family weakness such an assurance of the deepest disgrace she could neither wonder nor condemn but the belief of his self conquest brought nothing consolatory to her bosom afforded no palliation of her distress it was on the contrary exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him as now when all love must be vain but self though it would intrude could not engross her lydia the humiliation the misery she was bringing on them all soon swallowed up every private care and covering her face with her handkerchief elizabeth was soon lost to everything else and after a pause of several minutes was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion who in a manner which though it spoke compassion spoke likewise restraint said i am afraid you have been long desiring my absence nor have i anything to plead in excuse of my stay but real though unavailing concern would to heaven that anything could be either said or done on my part that might offer consolation to such distress but i will not torment you with vain wishes which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks this unfortunate affair will i fear prevent my sister s having the pleasure of seeing you at pemberley to day oh yes be so kind as to apologize for us to miss darcy say that urgent business calls us home immediately conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible i know it cannot be long he readily assured her of his secrecy again expressed his sorrow for her distress wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope and leaving his compliments for her relations with only one serious parting look went away as he quitted the room elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in derbyshire and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance so full of contradictions and varieties sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination if gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection elizabeth s change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty but if otherwise if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object and even before two words have been exchanged nothing can be said in her defence except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method in her partiality for wickham and that its ill success might perhaps authorize her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment be that as it may she saw him go with regret and in this early example of what lydia s infamy must produce found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business never since reading jane s second letter had she entertained a hope of wickham s meaning to marry her no one but jane she thought could flatter herself with such an expectation surprise was the least of all her feelings on this development while the contents of the first letter remained on her mind she was all surprise all astonishment that wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry for money and how lydia could ever have attached him had appeared incomprehensible but now it was all too natural for such an attachment as this she might have sufficient charms and though she did not suppose lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement without the intention of marriage she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey she had never perceived while the regiment was in hertfordshire that lydia had any partiality for him but she was convinced that lydia had wanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody sometimes one officer sometimes another had been her favourite as their attentions raised them in her opinion her affections had been continually fluctuating but never without an object the mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girl oh how acutely did she now feel it she was wild to be at home to hear to see to be upon the spot to share with jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her in a family so deranged a father absent a mother incapable of exertion and requiring constant attendance and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for lydia her uncle s interference seemed of the utmost importance and till he entered the room the misery of her impatience was severe mr and mrs gardiner had hurried back in alarm supposing by the servant s account that their niece was taken suddenly ill but satisfying them instantly on that head she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons reading the two letters aloud and dwelling on the postscript of the last with trembling energy though lydia had never been a favourite with them mr and mrs gardiner could not but be deeply affected not lydia only but all were concerned in it and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror mr gardiner readily promised every assistance in his power elizabeth though expecting no less thanked him with tears of gratitude and all three being actuated by one spirit everything relating to their journey was speedily settled they were to be off as soon as possible but what is to be done about pemberley cried mrs gardiner john told us mr darcy was here when you sent for us was it so yes and i told him we should not be able to keep our engagement that is all settled what is all settled repeated the other as she ran into her room to prepare and are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth oh that i knew how it was but wishes were vain or at best could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour had elizabeth been at leisure to be idle she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself but she had her share of business as well as her aunt and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends at lambton with false excuses for their sudden departure an hour however saw the whole completed and mr gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn nothing remained to be done but to go and elizabeth after all the misery of the morning found herself in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed seated in the carriage and on the road to longbourn illustration the first pleasing earnest of their welcome chapter xlvii illustration i have been thinking it over again elizabeth said her uncle as they drove from the town and really upon serious consideration i am much more inclined than i was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter it appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless and who was actually staying in his colonel s family that i am strongly inclined to hope the best could he expect that her friends would not step forward could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment after such an affront to colonel forster his temptation is not adequate to the risk do you really think so cried elizabeth brightening up for a moment upon my word said mrs gardiner i begin to be of your uncle s opinion it is really too great a violation of decency honour and interest for him to be guilty of it i cannot think so very ill of wickham can you yourself lizzie so wholly give him up as to believe him capable of it not perhaps of neglecting his own interest but of every other neglect i can believe him capable if indeed it should be so but i dare not hope it why should they not go on to scotland if that had been the case in the first place replied mr gardiner there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to scotland oh but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is such a presumption and besides no traces of them were to be found on the barnet road well then supposing them to be in london they may be there though for the purpose of concealment for no more exceptionable purpose it is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side and it might strike them that they could be more economically though less expeditiously married in london than in scotland but why all this secrecy why any fear of detection why must their marriage be private oh no no this is not likely his most particular friend you see by jane s account was persuaded of his never intending to marry her wickham will never marry a woman without some money he cannot afford it and what claims has lydia what attractions has she beyond youth health and good humour that could make him for her sake forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well as to what restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her i am not able to judge for i know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce but as to your other objection i am afraid it will hardly hold good lydia has no brothers to step forward and he might imagine from my father s behaviour from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family that he would do as little and think as little about it as any father could do in such a matter but can you think that lydia is so lost to everything but love of him as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage it does seem and it is most shocking indeed replied elizabeth with tears in her eyes that a sister s sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt but really i know not what to say perhaps i am not doing her justice but she is very young she has never been taught to think on serious subjects and for the last half year nay for a twelvemonth she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity she has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner and to adopt any opinions that came in her way since the shire were first quartered in meryton nothing but love flirtation and officers have been in her head she has been doing everything in her power by thinking and talking on the subject to give greater what shall i call it susceptibility to her feelings which are naturally lively enough and we all know that wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman but you see that jane said her aunt does not think so ill of wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt of whom does jane ever think ill and who is there whatever might be their former conduct that she would believe capable of such an attempt till it were proved against them but jane knows as well as i do what wickham really is we both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word that he has neither integrity nor honour that he is as false and deceitful as he is insinuating and do you really know all this cried mrs gardiner whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive i do indeed replied elizabeth colouring i told you the other day of his infamous behaviour to mr darcy and you yourself when last at longbourn heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him and there are other circumstances which i am not at liberty which it is not worth while to relate but his lies about the whole pemberley family are endless from what he said of miss darcy i was thoroughly prepared to see a proud reserved disagreeable girl yet he knew to the contrary himself he must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her but does lydia know nothing of this can she be ignorant of what you and jane seem so well to understand oh yes that that is the worst of all till i was in kent and saw so much both of mr darcy and his relation colonel fitzwilliam i was ignorant of the truth myself and when i returned home the shire was to leave meryton in a week or fortnight s time as that was the case neither jane to whom i related the whole nor i thought it necessary to make our knowledge public for of what use could it apparently be to anyone that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him should then be overthrown and even when it was settled that lydia should go with mrs forster the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me that she could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head that such a consequence as this should ensue you may easily believe was far enough from my thoughts when they all removed to brighton therefore you had no reason i suppose to believe them fond of each other not the slightest i can remember no symptom of affection on either side and had anything of the kind been perceptible you must be aware that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away when first he entered the corps she was ready enough to admire him but so we all were every girl in or near meryton was out of her senses about him for the first two months but he never distinguished her by any particular attention and consequently after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration her fancy for him gave way and others of the regiment who treated her with more distinction again became her favourites it may be easily believed that however little of novelty could be added to their fears hopes and conjectures on this interesting subject by its repeated discussion no other could detain them from it long during the whole of the journey from elizabeth s thoughts it was never absent fixed there by the keenest of all anguish self reproach she could find no interval of ease or forgetfulness they travelled as expeditiously as possible and sleeping one night on the road reached longbourn by dinnertime the next day it was a comfort to elizabeth to consider that jane could not have been wearied by long expectations the little gardiners attracted by the sight of a chaise were standing on the steps of the house as they entered the paddock and when the carriage drove up to the door the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces and displayed itself over their whole bodies in a variety of capers and frisks was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome elizabeth jumped out and after giving each of them a hasty kiss hurried into the vestibule where jane who came running downstairs from her mother s apartment immediately met her elizabeth as she affectionately embraced her whilst tears filled the eyes of both lost not a moment in asking whether anything had been heard of the fugitives not yet replied jane but now that my dear uncle is come i hope everything will be well is my father in town yes he went on tuesday as i wrote you word and have you heard from him often we have heard only once he wrote me a few lines on wednesday to say that he had arrived in safety and to give me his directions which i particularly begged him to do he merely added that he should not write again till he had something of importance to mention and my mother how is she how are you all my mother is tolerably well i trust though her spirits are greatly shaken she is upstairs and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all she does not yet leave her dressing room mary and kitty thank heaven are quite well but you how are you cried elizabeth you look pale how much you must have gone through her sister however assured her of her being perfectly well and their conversation which had been passing while mr and mrs gardiner were engaged with their children was now put an end to by the approach of the whole party jane ran to her uncle and aunt and welcomed and thanked them both with alternate smiles and tears when they were all in the drawing room the questions which elizabeth had already asked were of course repeated by the others and they soon found that jane had no intelligence to give the sanguine hope of good however which the benevolence of her heart suggested had not yet deserted her she still expected that it would all end well and that every morning would bring some letter either from lydia or her father to explain their proceedings and perhaps announce the marriage mrs bennet to whose apartment they all repaired after a few minutes conversation together received them exactly as might be expected with tears and lamentations of regret invectives against the villainous conduct of wickham and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage blaming everybody but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must be principally owing if i had been able said she to carry my point in going to brighton with all my family this would not have happened but poor dear lydia had nobody to take care of her why did the forsters ever let her go out of their sight i am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing if she had been well looked after i always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her but i was over ruled as i always am poor dear child and now here s mr bennet gone away and i know he will fight wickham wherever he meets him and then he will be killed and what is to become of us all the collinses will turn us out before he is cold in his grave and if you are not kind to us brother i do not know what we shall do they all exclaimed against such terrific ideas and mr gardiner after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family told her that he meant to be in london the very next day and would assist mr bennet in every endeavour for recovering lydia do not give way to useless alarm added he though it is right to be prepared for the worst there is no occasion to look on it as certain it is not quite a week since they left brighton in a few days more we may gain some news of them and till we know that they are not married and have no design of marrying do not let us give the matter over as lost as soon as i get to town i shall go to my brother and make him come home with me to gracechurch street and then we may consult together as to what is to be done oh my dear brother replied mrs bennet that is exactly what i could most wish for and now do when you get to town find them out wherever they may be and if they are not married already make them marry and as for wedding clothes do not let them wait for that but tell lydia she shall have as much money as she chooses to buy them after they are married and above all things keep mr bennet from fighting tell him what a dreadful state i am in that i am frightened out of my wits and have such tremblings such flutterings all over me such spasms in my side and pains in my head and such beatings at my heart that i can get no rest by night nor by day and tell my dear lydia not to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me for she does not know which are the best warehouses oh brother how kind you are i know you will contrive it all but mr gardiner though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause could not avoid recommending moderation to her as well in her hopes as her fears and after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on table they left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper who attended in the absence of her daughters though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family they did not attempt to oppose it for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants while they waited at table and judged it better that one only of the household and the one whom they could most trust should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject in the dining room they were soon joined by mary and kitty who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance before one came from her books and the other from her toilette the faces of both however were tolerably calm and no change was visible in either except that the loss of her favourite sister or the anger which she had herself incurred in the business had given something more of fretfulness than usual to the accents of kitty as for mary she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to elizabeth with a countenance of grave reflection soon after they were seated at table this is a most unfortunate affair and will probably be much talked of but we must stem the tide of malice and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly consolation then perceiving in elizabeth no inclination of replying she added unhappy as the event must be for lydia we may draw from it this useful lesson that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable that one false step involves her in endless ruin that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement but was too much oppressed to make any reply mary however continued to console herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before them in the afternoon the two elder miss bennets were able to be for half an hour by themselves and elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making any inquiries which jane was equally eager to satisfy after joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event which elizabeth considered as all but certain and miss bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible the former continued the subject by saying but tell me all and everything about it which i have not already heard give me further particulars what did colonel forster say had they no apprehension of anything before the elopement took place they must have seen them together for ever colonel forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality especially on lydia s side but nothing to give him any alarm i am so grieved for him his behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost he was coming to us in order to assure us of his concern before he had any idea of their not being gone to scotland when that apprehension first got abroad it hastened his journey and was denny convinced that wickham would not marry did he know of their intending to go off had colonel forster seen denny himself yes but when questioned by him denny denied knowing anything of their plan and would not give his real opinion about it he did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying and from that i am inclined to hope he might have been misunderstood before and till colonel forster came himself not one of you entertained a doubt i suppose of their being really married how was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains i felt a little uneasy a little fearful of my sister s happiness with him in marriage because i knew that his conduct had not been always quite right my father and mother knew nothing of that they only felt how imprudent a match it must be kitty then owned with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us that in lydia s last letter she had prepared her for such a step she had known it seems of their being in love with each other many weeks but not before they went to brighton no i believe not and did colonel forster appear to think ill of wickham himself does he know his real character i must confess that he did not speak so well of wickham as he formerly did he believed him to be imprudent and extravagant and since this sad affair has taken place it is said that he left meryton greatly in debt but i hope this may be false oh jane had we been less secret had we told what we knew of him this could not have happened perhaps it would have been better replied her sister but to expose the former faults of any person without knowing what their present feelings were seemed unjustifiable we acted with the best intentions could colonel forster repeat the particulars of lydia s note to his wife he brought it with him for us to see jane then took it from her pocket book and gave it to elizabeth these were the contents nind my dear harriet you will laugh when you know where i am gone and i cannot help laughing myself at your surprise to morrow morning as soon as i am missed i am going to gretna green and if you cannot guess with who i shall think you a simpleton for there is but one man in the world i love and he is an angel i should never be happy without him so think it no harm to be off you need not send them word at longbourn of my going if you do not like it for it will make the surprise the greater when i write to them and sign my name lydia wickham what a good joke it will be i can hardly write for laughing pray make my excuses to pratt for not keeping my engagement and dancing with him to night tell him i hope he will excuse me when he knows all and tell him i will dance with him at the next ball we meet with great pleasure i shall send for my clothes when i get to longbourn but i wish you would tell sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown before they are packed up good bye give my love to colonel forster i hope you will drink to our good journey your affectionate friend lydia bennet oh thoughtless thoughtless lydia cried elizabeth when she had finished it what a letter is this to be written at such a moment but at least it shows that she was serious in the object of her journey whatever he might afterwards persuade her to it was not on her side a scheme of infamy my poor father how he must have felt it i never saw anyone so shocked he could not speak a word for full ten minutes my mother was taken ill immediately and the whole house in such confusion oh jane cried elizabeth was there a servant belonging to it who did not know the whole story before the end of the day i do not know i hope there was but to be guarded at such a time is very difficult my mother was in hysterics and though i endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power i am afraid i did not do so much as i might have done but the horror of what might possibly happen almost took from me my faculties your attendance upon her has been too much for you you do not look well oh that i had been with you you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone mary and kitty have been very kind and would have shared in every fatigue i am sure but i did not think it right for either of them kitty is slight and delicate and mary studies so much that her hours of repose should not be broken in on my aunt philips came to longbourn on tuesday after my father went away and was so good as to stay till thursday with me she was of great use and comfort to us all and lady lucas has been very kind she walked here on wednesday morning to condole with us and offered her services or any of her daughters if they could be of use to us she had better have stayed at home cried elizabeth perhaps she meant well but under such a misfortune as this one cannot see too little of one s neighbours assistance is impossible condolence insufferable let them triumph over us at a distance and be satisfied she then proceeded to inquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue while in town for the recovery of his daughter he meant i believe replied jane to go to epsom the place where they last changed horses see the postilions and try if anything could be made out from them his principal object must be to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from clapham it had come with a fare from london and as he thought the circumstance of a gentleman and lady s removing from one carriage into another might be remarked he meant to make inquiries at clapham if he could anyhow discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare he determined to make inquiries there and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach i do not know of any other designs that he had formed but he was in such a hurry to be gone and his spirits so greatly discomposed that i had difficulty in finding out even so much as this illustration the post chapter xlviii illustration the whole party were in hopes of a letter from mr bennet the next morning but the post came in without bringing a single line from him his family knew him to be on all common occasions a most negligent and dilatory correspondent but at such a time they had hoped for exertion they were forced to conclude that he had no pleasing intelligence to send but even of that they would have been glad to be certain mr gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off when he was gone they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on and their uncle promised at parting to prevail on mr bennet to return to longbourn as soon as he could to the great consolation of his sister who considered it as the only security for her husband s not being killed in a duel mrs gardiner and the children were to remain in hertfordshire a few days longer as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces she shared in their attendance on mrs bennet and was a great comfort to them in their hours of freedom their other aunt also visited them frequently and always as she said with the design of cheering and heartening them up though as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of wickham s extravagance or irregularity she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them all meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who but three months before had been almost an angel of light he was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place and his intrigues all honoured with the title of seduction had been extended into every tradesman s family everybody declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world and everybody began to find out that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness elizabeth though she did not credit above half of what was said believed enough to make her former assurance of her sister s ruin still more certain and even jane who believed still less of it became almost hopeless more especially as the time was now come when if they had gone to scotland which she had never before entirely despaired of they must in all probability have gained some news of them mr gardiner left longbourn on sunday on tuesday his wife received a letter from him it told them that on his arrival he had immediately found out his brother and persuaded him to come to gracechurch street that mr bennet had been to epsom and clapham before his arrival but without gaining any satisfactory information and that he was now determined to inquire at all the principal hotels in town as mr bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them on their first coming to london before they procured lodgings mr gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure but as his brother was eager in it he meant to assist him in pursuing it he added that mr bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave london and promised to write again very soon there was also a postscript to this effect i have written to colonel forster to desire him to find out if possible from some of the young man s intimates in the regiment whether wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself if there were anyone that one could apply to with a probability of gaining such a clue as that it might be of essential consequence at present we have nothing to guide us colonel forster will i dare say do everything in his power to satisfy us on this head but on second thoughts perhaps lizzy could tell us what relations he has now living better than any other person elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for her authority proceeded but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved she had never heard of his having had any relations except a father and mother both of whom had been dead many years it was possible however that some of his companions in the shire might be able to give more information and though she was not very sanguine in expecting it the application was a something to look forward to every day at longbourn was now a day of anxiety but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected the arrival of letters was the first grand object of every morning s impatience through letters whatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance but before they heard again from mr gardiner a letter arrived for their father from a different quarter from mr collins which as jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence she accordingly read and elizabeth who knew what curiosities his letters always were looked over her and read it likewise it was as follows my dear sir i feel myself called upon by our relationship and my situation in life to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from hertfordshire be assured my dear sir that mrs collins and myself sincerely sympathize with you and all your respectable family in your present distress which must be of the bitterest kind because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove no arguments shall be wanting on my part that can alleviate so severe a misfortune or that may comfort you under a circumstance that must be of all others most afflicting to a parent s mind the death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this and it is the more to be lamented because there is reason to suppose as my dear charlotte informs me that this licentiousness of behaviour in your illustration to whom i have related the affair copyright by george allen daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence though at the same time for the consolation of yourself and mrs bennet i am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad or she could not be guilty of such an enormity at so early an age howsoever that may be you are grievously to be pitied in which opinion i am not only joined by mrs collins but likewise by lady catherine and her daughter to whom i have related the affair they agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others for who as lady catherine herself condescendingly says will connect themselves with such a family and this consideration leads me moreover to reflect with augmented satisfaction on a certain event of last november for had it been otherwise i must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace let me advise you then my dear sir to console yourself as much as possible to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever and leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous offence i am dear sir etc etc mr gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer from colonel forster and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send it was not known that wickham had a single relation with whom he kept up any connection and it was certain that he had no near one living his former acquaintance had been numerous but since he had been in the militia it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them there was no one therefore who could be pointed out as likely to give any news of him and in the wretched state of his own finances there was a very powerful motive for secrecy in addition to his fear of discovery by lydia s relations for it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him to a very considerable amount colonel forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expenses at brighton he owed a good deal in the town but his debts of honour were still more formidable mr gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the longbourn family jane heard them with horror a gamester she cried this is wholly unexpected i had not an idea of it mr gardiner added in his letter that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day which was saturday rendered spiritless by the ill success of all their endeavours he had yielded to his brother in law s entreaty that he would return to his family and leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit when mrs bennet was told of this she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected considering what her anxiety for his life had been before what is he coming home and without poor lydia she cried sure he will not leave london before he has found them who is to fight wickham and make him marry her if he comes away as mrs gardiner began to wish to be at home it was settled that she and her children should go to london at the same time that mr bennet came from it the coach therefore took them the first stage of their journey and brought its master back to longbourn mrs gardiner went away in all the perplexity about elizabeth and her derbyshire friend that had attended her from that part of the world his name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece and the kind of half expectation which mrs gardiner had formed of their being followed by a letter from him had ended in nothing elizabeth had received none since her return that could come from pemberley the present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary nothing therefore could be fairly conjectured from that though elizabeth who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings was perfectly aware that had she known nothing of darcy she could have borne the dread of lydia s infamy somewhat better it would have spared her she thought one sleepless night out of two when mr bennet arrived he had all the appearance of his usual philosophic composure he said as little as he had ever been in the habit of saying made no mention of the business that had taken him away and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of it it was not till the afternoon when he joined them at tea that elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject and then on her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured he replied say nothing of that who should suffer but myself it has been my own doing and i ought to feel it you must not be too severe upon yourself replied elizabeth you may well warn me against such an evil human nature is so prone to fall into it no lizzy let me once in my life feel how much i have been to blame i am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression it will pass away soon enough do you suppose them to be in london yes where else can they be so well concealed and lydia used to want to go to london added kitty she is happy then said her father drily and her residence there will probably be of some duration then after a short silence he continued lizzy i bear you no ill will for being justified in your advice to me last may which considering the event shows some greatness of mind they were interrupted by miss bennet who came to fetch her mother s tea this is a parade cried he which does one good it gives such an elegance to misfortune another day i will do the same i will sit in my library in my nightcap and powdering gown and give as much trouble as i can or perhaps i may defer it till kitty runs away i am not going to run away papa said kitty fretfully if i should ever go to brighton i would behave better than lydia you go to brighton i would not trust you so near it as eastbourne for fifty pounds no kitty i have at least learnt to be cautious and you will feel the effects of it no officer is ever to enter my house again nor even to pass through the village balls will be absolutely prohibited unless you stand up with one of your sisters and you are never to stir out of doors till you can prove that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner kitty who took all these threats in a serious light began to cry well well said he do not make yourself unhappy if you are a good girl for the next ten years i will take you to a review at the end of them illustration chapter xlix illustration two days after mr bennet s return as jane and elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house they saw the housekeeper coming towards them and concluding that she came to call them to their mother went forward to meet her but instead of the expected summons when they approached her she said to miss bennet i beg your pardon madam for interrupting you but i was in hopes you might have got some good news from town so i took the liberty of coming to ask what do you mean hill we have heard nothing from town dear madam cried mrs hill in great astonishment don t you know there is an express come for master from mr gardiner he has been here this half hour and master has had a letter away ran the girls too eager to get in to have time for speech they ran through the vestibule into the breakfast room from thence to the library their father was in neither and they were on the point of seeking him upstairs with their mother when they were met by the butler who said if you are looking for my master ma am he is walking towards the little copse upon this information they instantly passed through the hall once more and ran across the lawn after their father who was deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock jane who was not so light nor so much in the habit of running as elizabeth soon lagged behind while her sister panting for breath came up with him and eagerly cried out oh papa what news what news have you heard from my uncle yes i have had a letter from him by express well and what news does it bring good or bad what is there of good to be expected said he taking the letter from his pocket but perhaps you would like to read it elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand jane now came up read it aloud said their father for i hardly know myself what it is about right gracechurch street monday august my dear brother at last i am able to send you some tidings of my niece and such as upon the whole i hope will give you satisfaction soon after you left me on saturday i was fortunate enough to find out in what part of london they were the particulars i reserve till we meet it is enough to know they are discovered i have seen them both illustration but perhaps you would like to read it copyright by george allen then it is as i always hoped cried jane they are married elizabeth read on i have seen them both they are not married nor can i find there was any intention of being so but if you are willing to perform the engagements which i have ventured to make on your side i hope it will not be long before they are all that is required of you is to assure to your daughter by settlement her equal share of the five thousand pounds secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister and moreover to enter into an engagement of allowing her during your life one hundred pounds per annum these are conditions which considering everything i had no hesitation in complying with as far as i thought myself privileged for you i shall send this by express that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer you will easily comprehend from these particulars that mr wickham s circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be the world has been deceived in that respect and i am happy to say there will be some little money even when all his debts are discharged to settle on my niece in addition to her own fortune if as i conclude will be the case you send me full powers to act in your name throughout the whole of this business i will immediately give directions to haggerston for preparing a proper settlement there will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again therefore stay quietly at longbourn and depend on my diligence and care send back your answer as soon as you can and be careful to write explicitly we have judged it best that my niece should be married from this house of which i hope you will approve she comes to us to day i shall write again as soon as anything more is determined on yours etc edw gardiner is it possible cried elizabeth when she had finished can it be possible that he will marry her wickham is not so undeserving then as we have thought him said her sister my dear father i congratulate you and have you answered the letter said elizabeth no but it must be done soon most earnestly did she then entreat him to lose no more time before he wrote oh my dear father she cried come back and write immediately consider how important every moment is in such a case let me write for you said jane if you dislike the trouble yourself i dislike it very much he replied but it must be done and so saying he turned back with them and walked towards the house and may i ask said elizabeth but the terms i suppose must be complied with complied with i am only ashamed of his asking so little and they must marry yet he is such a man yes yes they must marry there is nothing else to be done but there are two things that i want very much to know one is how much money your uncle has laid down to bring it about and the other how i am ever to pay him money my uncle cried jane what do you mean sir i mean that no man in his proper senses would marry lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a year during my life and fifty after i am gone that is very true said elizabeth though it had not occurred to me before his debts to be discharged and something still to remain oh it must be my uncle s doings generous good man i am afraid he has distressed himself a small sum could not do all this no said her father wickham s a fool if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds i should be sorry to think so ill of him in the very beginning of our relationship ten thousand pounds heaven forbid how is half such a sum to be repaid mr bennet made no answer and each of them deep in thought continued silent till they reached the house their father then went to the library to write and the girls walked into the breakfast room and they are really to be married cried elizabeth as soon as they were by themselves how strange this is and for this we are to be thankful that they should marry small as is their chance of happiness and wretched as is his character we are forced to rejoice oh lydia i comfort myself with thinking replied jane that he certainly would not marry lydia if he had not a real regard for her though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him i cannot believe that ten thousand pounds or anything like it has been advanced he has children of his own and may have more how could he spare half ten thousand pounds if we are ever able to learn what wickham s debts have been said elizabeth and how much is settled on his side on our sister we shall exactly know what mr gardiner has done for them because wickham has not sixpence of his own the kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited their taking her home and affording her their personal protection and countenance is such a sacrifice to her advantage as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge by this time she is actually with them if such goodness does not make her miserable now she will never deserve to be happy what a meeting for her when she first sees my aunt we must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side said jane i hope and trust they will yet be happy his consenting to marry her is a proof i will believe that he is come to a right way of thinking their mutual affection will steady them and i flatter myself they will settle so quietly and live in so rational a manner as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten their conduct has been such replied elizabeth as neither you nor i nor anybody can ever forget it is useless to talk of it it now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened they went to the library therefore and asked their father whether he would not wish them to make it known to her he was writing and without raising his head coolly replied just as you please may we take my uncle s letter to read to her take whatever you like and get away elizabeth took the letter from his writing table and they went upstairs together mary and kitty were both with mrs bennet one communication would therefore do for all after a slight preparation for good news the letter was read aloud mrs bennet could hardly contain herself as soon as jane had read mr gardiner s hope of lydia s being soon married her joy burst forth and every following sentence added to its exuberance she was now in an irritation as violent from delight as she had ever been fidgety from alarm and vexation to know that her daughter would be married was enough she was disturbed by no fear for her felicity nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct my dear dear lydia she cried this is delightful indeed she will be married i shall see her again she will be married at sixteen my good kind brother i knew how it would be i knew he would manage everything how i long to see her and to see dear wickham too but the clothes the wedding clothes i will write to my sister gardiner about them directly lizzy my dear run down to your father and ask him how much he will give her stay stay i will go myself ring the bell kitty for hill i will put on my things in a moment my dear dear lydia how merry we shall be together when we meet her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports by leading her thoughts to the obligations which mr gardiner s behaviour laid them all under for we must attribute this happy conclusion she added in a great measure to his kindness we are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist mr wickham with money well cried her mother it is all very right who should do it but her own uncle if he had not had a family of his own i and my children must have had all his money you know and it is the first time we have ever had anything from him except a few presents well i am so happy in a short time i shall have a daughter married mrs wickham how well it sounds and she was only sixteen last june my dear jane i am in such a flutter that i am sure i can t write so i will dictate and you write for me we will settle with your father about the money afterwards but the things should be ordered immediately she was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico muslin and cambric and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders had not jane though with some difficulty persuaded her to wait till her father was at leisure to be consulted one day s delay she observed would be of small importance and her mother was too happy to be quite so obstinate as usual other schemes too came into her head i will go to meryton said she as soon as i am dressed and tell the good good news to my sister philips and as i come back i can call on lady lucas and mrs long kitty run down and order the carriage an airing would do me a great deal of good i am sure girls can i do anything for you in meryton oh here comes hill my dear hill have you heard the good news miss lydia is going to be married and you shall all have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding mrs hill began instantly to express her joy elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest and then sick of this folly took refuge in her own room that she might think with freedom poor lydia s situation must at best be bad enough but that it was no worse she had need to be thankful she felt it so and though in looking forward neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity could be justly expected for her sister in looking back to what they had feared only two hours ago she felt all the advantages of what they had gained illustration the spiteful old ladies copyright by george allen chapter l illustration mr bennet had very often wished before this period of his life that instead of spending his whole income he had laid by an annual sum for the better provision of his children and of his wife if she survived him he now wished it more than ever had he done his duty in that respect lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her the satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in great britain to be her husband might then have rested in its proper place he was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to anyone should be forwarded at the sole expense of his brother in law and he was determined if possible to find out the extent of his assistance and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could when first mr bennet had married economy was held to be perfectly useless for of course they were to have a son this son was to join in cutting off the entail as soon as he should be of age and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for five daughters successively entered the world but yet the son was to come and mrs bennet for many years after lydia s birth had been certain that he would this event had at last been despaired of but it was then too late to be saving mrs bennet had no turn for economy and her husband s love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their income five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on mrs bennet and the children but in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter depended on the will of the parents this was one point with regard to lydia at least which was now to be settled and mr bennet could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him in terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother though expressed most concisely he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done and his willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for him he had never before supposed that could wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present arrangement he would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser by the hundred that was to be paid them for what with her board and pocket allowance and the continual presents in money which passed to her through her mother s hands lydia s expenses had been very little within that sum that it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side too was another very welcome surprise for his chief wish at present was to have as little trouble in the business as possible when the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over he naturally returned to all his former indolence his letter was soon despatched for though dilatory in undertaking business he was quick in its execution he begged to know further particulars of what he was indebted to his brother but was too angry with lydia to send any message to her the good news quickly spread through the house and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood it was borne in the latter with decent philosophy to be sure it would have been more for the advantage of conversation had miss lydia bennet come upon the town or as the happiest alternative been secluded from the world in some distant farm house but there was much to be talked of in marrying her and the good natured wishes for her well doing which had proceeded before from all the spiteful old ladies in meryton lost but little of their spirit in this change of circumstances because with such a husband her misery was considered certain it was a fortnight since mrs bennet had been down stairs but on this happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table and in spirits oppressively high no sentiment of shame gave a damp to her triumph the marriage of a daughter which had been the first object of her wishes since jane was sixteen was now on the point of accomplishment and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials fine muslins new carriages and servants she was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter and without knowing or considering what their income might be rejected many as deficient in size and importance haye park might do said she if the gouldings would quit it or the great house at stoke if the drawing room were larger but ashworth is too far off i could not bear to have her ten miles from me and as for purvis lodge the attics are dreadful her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the servants remained but when they had withdrawn he said to her mrs bennet before you take any or all of these houses for your son and daughter let us come to a right understanding into one house in this neighbourhood they shall never have admittance i will not encourage the imprudence of either by receiving them at longbourn a long dispute followed this declaration but mr bennet was firm it soon led to another and mrs bennet found with amazement and horror that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter he protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever on the occasion mrs bennet could hardly comprehend it that his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege without which her marriage would scarcely seem valid exceeded all that she could believe possible she was more alive to the disgrace which her want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter s nuptials than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with wickham a fortnight before they took place elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had from the distress of the moment been led to make mr darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the spot she had no fear of its spreading farther through his means there were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended but at the same time there was no one whose knowledge of a sister s frailty would have mortified her so much not however from any fear of disadvantage from it individually to herself for at any rate there seemed a gulf impassable between them had lydia s marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms it was not to be supposed that mr darcy would connect himself with a family where to every other objection would now be added an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned from such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink the wish of procuring her regard which she had assured herself of his feeling in derbyshire could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this she was humbled she was grieved she repented though she hardly knew of what she became jealous of his esteem when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it she wanted to hear of him when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence she was convinced that she could have been happy with him when it was no longer likely they should meet what a triumph for him as she often thought could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago would now have been gladly and gratefully received he was as generous she doubted not as the most generous of his sex but while he was mortal there must be a triumph she began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who in disposition and talents would most suit her his understanding and temper though unlike her own would have answered all her wishes it was an union that must have been to the advantage of both by her ease and liveliness his mind might have been softened his manners improved and from his judgment information and knowledge of the world she must have received benefit of greater importance but no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what connubial felicity really was an union of a different tendency and precluding the possibility of the other was soon to be formed in their family how wickham and lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence she could not imagine but how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions were stronger than their virtue she could easily conjecture mr gardiner soon wrote again to his brother to mr bennet s acknowledgments he briefly replied with assurances of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family and concluded with entreaties that the subject might never be mentioned to him again the principal purport of his letter was to inform them that mr wickham had resolved on quitting the militia it was greatly my wish that he should do so he added as soon as his marriage was fixed on and i think you will agree with me in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable both on his account and my niece s it is mr wickham s intention to go into the regulars and among his former friends there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army he has the promise of an ensigncy in general s regiment now quartered in the north it is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom he promises fairly and i hope among different people where they may each have a character to preserve they will both be more prudent i have written to colonel forster to inform him of our present arrangements and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of mr wickham in and near brighton with assurances of speedy payment for which i have pledged myself and will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in meryton of whom i shall subjoin a list according to his information he has given in all his debts i hope at least he has not deceived us haggerston has our directions and all will be completed in a week they will then join his regiment unless they are first invited to longbourn and i understand from mrs gardiner that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she leaves the south she is well and begs to be dutifully remembered to you and her mother yours etc e gardiner mr bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of wickham s removal from the shire as clearly as mr gardiner could do but mrs bennet was not so well pleased with it lydia s being settled in the north just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in hertfordshire was a severe disappointment and besides it was such a pity that lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with everybody and had so many favourites she is so fond of mrs forster said she it will be quite shocking to send her away and there are several of the young men too that she likes very much the officers may not be so pleasant in general s regiment his daughter s request for such it might be considered of being admitted into her family again before she set off for the north received at first an absolute negative but jane and elizabeth who agreed in wishing for the sake of their sister s feelings and consequence that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents urged him so earnestly yet so rationally and so mildly to receive her and her husband at longbourn as soon as they were married that he was prevailed on to think as they thought and act as they wished and their mother had the satisfaction of knowing that she should be able to show her married daughter in the neighbourhood before she was banished to the north when mr bennet wrote again to his brother therefore he sent his permission for them to come and it was settled that as soon as the ceremony was over they should proceed to longbourn elizabeth was surprised however that wickham should consent to such a scheme and had she consulted only her own inclination any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes illustration with an affectionate smile copyright by george allen chapter li illustration their sister s wedding day arrived and jane and elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself the carriage was sent to meet them at and they were to return in it by dinnertime their arrival was dreaded by the elder miss bennets and jane more especially who gave lydia the feelings which would have attended herself had she been the culprit and was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure they came the family were assembled in the breakfast room to receive them smiles decked the face of mrs bennet as the carriage drove up to the door her husband looked impenetrably grave her daughters alarmed anxious uneasy lydia s voice was heard in the vestibule the door was thrown open and she ran into the room her mother stepped forwards embraced her and welcomed her with rapture gave her hand with an affectionate smile to wickham who followed his lady and wished them both joy with an alacrity which showed no doubt of their happiness their reception from mr bennet to whom they then turned was not quite so cordial his countenance rather gained in austerity and he scarcely opened his lips the easy assurance of the young couple indeed was enough to provoke him elizabeth was disgusted and even miss bennet was shocked lydia was lydia still untamed unabashed wild noisy and fearless she turned from sister to sister demanding their congratulations and when at length they all sat down looked eagerly round the room took notice of some little alteration in it and observed with a laugh that it was a great while since she had been there wickham was not at all more distressed than herself but his manners were always so pleasing that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought his smiles and his easy address while he claimed their relationship would have delighted them all elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance but she sat down resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man she blushed and jane blushed but the cheeks of the two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of colour there was no want of discourse the bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough and wickham who happened to sit near elizabeth began inquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood with a good humoured ease which she felt very unable to equal in her replies they seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world nothing of the past was recollected with pain and lydia led voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world only think of its being three months she cried since i went away it seems but a fortnight i declare and yet there have been things enough happened in the time good gracious when i went away i am sure i had no more idea of being married till i came back again though i thought it would be very good fun if i was her father lifted up his eyes jane was distressed elizabeth looked expressively at lydia but she who never heard nor saw anything of which she chose to be insensible gaily continued oh mamma do the people hereabouts know i am married to day i was afraid they might not and we overtook william goulding in his curricle so i was determined he should know it and so i let down the side glass next to him and took off my glove and let my hand just rest upon the window frame so that he might see the ring and then i bowed and smiled like anything elizabeth could bear it no longer she got up and ran out of the room and returned no more till she heard them passing through the hall to the dining parlour she then joined them soon enough to see lydia with anxious parade walk up to her mother s right hand and hear her say to her eldest sister ah jane i take your place now and you must go lower because i am a married woman it was not to be supposed that time would give lydia that embarrassment from which she had been so wholly free at first her ease and good spirits increased she longed to see mrs philips the lucases and all their other neighbours and to hear herself called mrs wickham by each of them and in the meantime she went after dinner to show her ring and boast of being married to mrs hill and the two housemaids well mamma said she when they were all returned to the breakfast room and what do you think of my husband is not he a charming man i am sure my sisters must all envy me i only hope they may have half my good luck they must all go to brighton that is the place to get husbands what a pity it is mamma we did not all go very true and if i had my will we should but my dear lydia i don t at all like your going such a way off must it be so oh lord yes there is nothing in that i shall like it of all things you and papa and my sisters must come down and see us we shall be at newcastle all the winter and i dare say there will be some balls and i will take care to get good partners for them all i should like it beyond anything said her mother and then when you go away you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you and i dare say i shall get husbands for them before the winter is over i thank you for my share of the favour said elizabeth but i do not particularly like your way of getting husbands their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them mr wickham had received his commission before he left london and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight no one but mrs bennet regretted that their stay would be so short and she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter and having very frequent parties at home these parties were acceptable to all to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think than such as did not wickham s affection for lydia was just what elizabeth had expected to find it not equal to lydia s for him she had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied from the reason of things that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love rather than by his and she would have wondered why without violently caring for her he chose to elope with her at all had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances and if that were the case he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion lydia was exceedingly fond of him he was her dear wickham on every occasion no one was to be put in competition with him he did everything best in the world and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of september than anybody else in the country one morning soon after their arrival as she was sitting with her two elder sisters she said to elizabeth lizzy i never gave you an account of my wedding i believe you were not by when i told mamma and the others all about it are not you curious to hear how it was managed no really replied elizabeth i think there cannot be too little said on the subject la you are so strange but i must tell you how it went off we were married you know at st clement s because wickham s lodgings were in that parish and it was settled that we should all be there by eleven o clock my uncle and aunt and i were to go together and the others were to meet us at the church well monday morning came and i was in such a fuss i was so afraid you know that something would happen to put it off and then i should have gone quite distracted and there was my aunt all the time i was dressing preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon however i did not hear above one word in ten for i was thinking you may suppose of my dear wickham i longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat well and so we breakfasted at ten as usual i thought it would never be over for by the bye you are to understand that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time i was with them if you ll believe me i did not once put my foot out of doors though i was there a fortnight not one party or scheme or anything to be sure london was rather thin but however the little theatre was open well and so just as the carriage came to the door my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man mr stone and then you know when once they get together there is no end of it well i was so frightened i did not know what to do for my uncle was to give me away and if we were beyond the hour we could not be married all day but luckily he came back again in ten minutes time and then we all set out however i recollected afterwards that if he had been prevented going the wedding need not be put off for mr darcy might have done as well mr darcy repeated elizabeth in utter amazement oh yes he was to come there with wickham you know but gracious me i quite forgot i ought not to have said a word about it i promised them so faithfully what will wickham say it was to be such a secret if it was to be a secret said jane say not another word on the subject you may depend upon my seeking no further oh certainly said elizabeth though burning with curiosity we will ask you no questions thank you said lydia for if you did i should certainly tell you all and then wickham would be so angry on such encouragement to ask elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power by running away but to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible or at least it was impossible not to try for information mr darcy had been at her sister s wedding it was exactly a scene and exactly among people where he had apparently least to do and least temptation to go conjectures as to the meaning of it rapid and wild hurried into her brain but she was satisfied with none those that best pleased her as placing his conduct in the noblest light seemed most improbable she could not bear such suspense and hastily seizing a sheet of paper wrote a short letter to her aunt to request an explanation of what lydia had dropped if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended you may readily comprehend she added what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us and comparatively speaking a stranger to our family should have been amongst you at such a time pray write instantly and let me understand it unless it is for very cogent reasons to remain in the secrecy which lydia seems to think necessary and then i must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance not that i shall though she added to herself and she finished the letter and my dear aunt if you do not tell me in an honourable manner i shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out jane s delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to elizabeth privately of what lydia had let fall elizabeth was glad of it till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction she had rather be without a confidante illustration i am sure she did not listen chapter lii illustration elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as soon as she possibly could she was no sooner in possession of it than hurrying into the little copse where she was least likely to be interrupted she sat down on one of the benches and prepared to be happy for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial right gracechurch street sept my dear niece i have just received your letter and shall devote this whole morning to answering it as i foresee that a little writing will not comprise what i have to tell you i must confess myself surprised by your application i did not expect it from you don t think me angry however for i only mean to let you know that i had not imagined such inquiries to be necessary on your side if you do not choose to understand me forgive my impertinence your uncle is as much surprised as i am and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed him to act as he has done but if you are really innocent and ignorant i must be more explicit on the very day of my coming home from longbourn your uncle had a most unexpected visitor mr darcy called and was shut up with him several hours it was all over before i arrived so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as yours seems to have been he came to tell mr gardiner that he had found out where your sister and mr wickham were and that he had seen and talked with them both wickham repeatedly lydia once from what i can collect he left derbyshire only one day after ourselves and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them the motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to himself that wickham s worthlessness had not been so well known as to make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide in him he generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private actions open to the world his character was to speak for itself he called it therefore his duty to step forward and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on by himself if he had another motive i am sure it would never disgrace him he had been some days in town before he was able to discover them but he had something to direct his search which was more than we had and the consciousness of this was another reason for his resolving to follow us there is a lady it seems a mrs younge who was some time ago governess to miss darcy and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation though he did not say what she then took a large house in edward street and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings this mrs younge was he knew intimately acquainted with wickham and he went to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got to town but it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted she would not betray her trust i suppose without bribery and corruption for she really did know where her friend was to be found wickham indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in london and had she been able to receive them into her house they would have taken up their abode with her at length however our kind friend procured the wished for direction they were in street he saw wickham and afterwards insisted on seeing lydia his first object with her he acknowledged had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her offering his assistance as far as it would go but he found lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was she cared for none of her friends she wanted no help of his she would not hear of leaving wickham she was sure they should be married some time or other and it did not much signify when since such were her feelings it only remained he thought to secure and expedite a marriage which in his very first conversation with wickham he easily learnt had never been his design he confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment on account of some debts of honour which were very pressing and scrupled not to lay all the ill consequences of lydia s flight on her own folly alone he meant to resign his commission immediately and as to his future situation he could conjecture very little about it he must go somewhere but he did not know where and he knew he should have nothing to live on mr darcy asked why he did not marry your sister at once though mr bennet was not imagined to be very rich he would have been able to do something for him and his situation must have been benefited by marriage but he found in reply to this question that wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in some other country under such circumstances however he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief they met several times for there was much to be discussed wickham of course wanted more than he could get but at length was reduced to be reasonable everything being settled between them mr darcy s next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it and he first called in gracechurch street the evening before i came home but mr gardiner could not be seen and mr darcy found on further inquiry that your father was still with him but would quit town the next morning he did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the departure of the former he did not leave his name and till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had called on business on saturday he came again your father was gone your uncle at home and as i said before they had a great deal of talk together they met again on sunday and then i saw him too it was not all settled before monday as soon as it was the express was sent off to longbourn but our visitor was very obstinate i fancy lizzy that obstinacy is the real defect of his character after all he has been accused of many faults at different times but this is the true one nothing was to be done that he did not do himself though i am sure and i do not speak it to be thanked therefore say nothing about it your uncle would most readily have settled the whole they battled it together for a long time which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved but at last your uncle was forced to yield and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it which went sorely against the grain and i really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers and give the praise where it was due but lizzy this must go no further than yourself or jane at most you know pretty well i suppose what has been done for the young people his debts are to be paid amounting i believe to considerably more than a thousand pounds another thousand in addition to her own settled upon her and his commission purchased the reason why all this was to be done by him alone was such as i have given above it was owing to him to his reserve and want of proper consideration that wickham s character had been so misunderstood and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was perhaps there was some truth in this though i doubt whether his reserve or anybody s reserve can be answerable for the event but in spite of all this fine talking my dear lizzy you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would never have yielded if we had not given him credit for another interest in the affair when all this was resolved on he returned again to his friends who were still staying at pemberley but it was agreed that he should be in london once more when the wedding took place and all money matters were then to receive the last finish i believe i have now told you everything it is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise i hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure lydia came to us and wickham had constant admission to the house he was exactly what he had been when i knew him in hertfordshire but i would not tell you how little i was satisfied with her behaviour while she stayed with us if i had not perceived by jane s letter last wednesday that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it and therefore what i now tell you can give you no fresh pain i talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner representing to her the wickedness of what she had done and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family if she heard me it was by good luck for i am sure she did not listen i was sometimes quite provoked but then i recollected my dear elizabeth and jane and for their sakes had patience with her mr darcy was punctual in his return and as lydia informed you attended the wedding he dined with us the next day and was to leave town again on wednesday or thursday will you be very angry with me my dear lizzy if i take this opportunity of saying what i was never bold enough to say before how much i like him his behaviour to us has in every respect been as pleasing as when we were in derbyshire his understanding and opinions all please me he wants nothing but a little more liveliness and that if he marry prudently his wife may teach him i thought him very sly he hardly ever mentioned your name but slyness seems the fashion pray forgive me if i have been very presuming or at least do not punish me so far as to exclude me from p i shall never be quite happy till i have been all round the park a low phaeton with a nice little pair of ponies would be the very thing but i must write no more the children have been wanting me this half hour yours very sincerely m gardiner the contents of this letter threw elizabeth into a flutter of spirits in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share the vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what mr darcy might have been doing to forward her sister s match which she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable and at the same time dreaded to be just from the pain of obligation were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true he had followed them purposely to town he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise and where he was reduced to meet frequently meet reason with persuade and finally bribe the man whom he always most wished to avoid and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce he had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem her heart did whisper that he had done it for her but it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient when required to depend on his affection for her for a woman who had already refused him as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with wickham brother in law of wickham every kind of pride must revolt from the connection he had to be sure done much she was ashamed to think how much but he had given a reason for his interference which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief it was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong he had liberality and he had the means of exercising it and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement she could perhaps believe that remaining partiality for her might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned it was painful exceedingly painful to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return they owed the restoration of lydia her character everything to him oh how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him for herself she was humbled but she was proud of him proud that in a cause of compassion and honour he had been able to get the better of himself she read over her aunt s commendation of him again and again it was hardly enough but it pleased her she was even sensible of some pleasure though mixed with regret on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between mr darcy and herself she was roused from her seat and her reflections by someone s approach and before she could strike into another path she was overtaken by wickham i am afraid i interrupt your solitary ramble my dear sister said he as he joined her you certainly do she replied with a smile but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome i should be sorry indeed if it were we were always good friends and now we are better true are the others coming out i do not know mrs bennet and lydia are going in the carriage to meryton and so my dear sister i find from our uncle and aunt that you have actually seen pemberley she replied in the affirmative i almost envy you the pleasure and yet i believe it would be too much for me or else i could take it in my way to newcastle and you saw the old housekeeper i suppose poor reynolds she was always very fond of me but of course she did not mention my name to you yes she did and what did she say that you were gone into the army and she was afraid had not turned out well at such a distance as that you know things are strangely misrepresented certainly he replied biting his lips elizabeth hoped she had silenced him but he soon afterwards said i was surprised to see darcy in town last month we passed each other several times i wonder what he can be doing there perhaps preparing for his marriage with miss de bourgh said elizabeth it must be something particular to take him there at this time of year undoubtedly did you see him while you were at lambton i thought i understood from the gardiners that you had yes he introduced us to his sister and do you like her very much i have heard indeed that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two when i last saw her she was not very promising i am very glad you liked her i hope she will turn out well i dare say she will she has got over the most trying age did you go by the village of kympton i do not recollect that we did i mention it because it is the living which i ought to have had a most delightful place excellent parsonage house it would have suited me in every respect how should you have liked making sermons exceedingly well i should have considered it as part of my duty and the exertion would soon have been nothing one ought not to repine but to be sure it would have been such a thing for me the quiet the retirement of such a life would have answered all my ideas of happiness but it was not to be did you ever hear darcy mention the circumstance when you were in kent i have heard from authority which i thought as good that it was left you conditionally only and at the will of the present patron you have yes there was something in that i told you so from the first you may remember i did hear too that there was a time when sermon making was not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders and that the business had been compromised accordingly you did and it was not wholly without foundation you may remember what i told you on that point when first we talked of it they were now almost at the door of the house for she had walked fast to get rid of him and unwilling for her sister s sake to provoke him she only said in reply with a good humoured smile come mr wickham we are brother and sister you know do not let us quarrel about the past in future i hope we shall be always of one mind she held out her hand he kissed it with affectionate gallantry though he hardly knew how to look and they entered the house illustration mr darcy with him chapter liii illustration mr wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation that he never again distressed himself or provoked his dear sister elizabeth by introducing the subject of it and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet the day of his and lydia s departure soon came and mrs bennet was forced to submit to a separation which as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to newcastle was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth oh my dear lydia she cried when shall we meet again oh lord i don t know not these two or three years perhaps write to me very often my dear as often as i can but you know married women have never much time for writing my sisters may write to me they will have nothing else to do mr wickham s adieus were much more affectionate than his wife s he smiled looked handsome and said many pretty things he is as fine a fellow said mr bennet as soon as they were out of the house as ever i saw he simpers and smirks and makes love to us all i am prodigiously proud of him i defy even sir william lucas himself to produce a more valuable son in law the loss of her daughter made mrs bennet very dull for several days i often think said she that there is nothing so bad as parting with one s friends one seems so forlorn without them this is the consequence you see madam of marrying a daughter said elizabeth it must make you better satisfied that your other four are single it is no such thing lydia does not leave me because she is married but only because her husband s regiment happens to be so far off if that had been nearer she would not have gone so soon but the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortly relieved and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope by an article of news which then began to be in circulation the housekeeper at netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master who was coming down in a day or two to shoot there for several weeks mrs bennet was quite in the fidgets she looked at jane and smiled and shook her head by turns well well and so mr bingley is coming down sister for mrs philips first brought her the news well so much the better not that i care about it though he is nothing to us you know and i am sure i never want to see him again but however he is very welcome to come to netherfield if he likes it and who knows what may happen but that is nothing to us you know sister we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it and so it is quite certain he is coming you may depend on it replied the other for mrs nichols was in meryton last night i saw her passing by and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it and she told me that it was certainly true he comes down on thursday at the latest very likely on wednesday she was going to the butcher s she told me on purpose to order in some meat on wednesday and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed miss bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing colour it was many months since she had mentioned his name to elizabeth but now as soon as they were alone together she said i saw you look at me to day lizzy when my aunt told us of the present report and i know i appeared distressed but don t imagine it was from any silly cause i was only confused for the moment because i felt that i should be looked at i do assure you that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain i am glad of one thing that he comes alone because we shall see the less of him not that i am afraid of myself but i dread other people s remarks elizabeth did not know what to make of it had she not seen him in derbyshire she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no other view than what was acknowledged but she still thought him partial to jane and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there with his friend s permission or being bold enough to come without it yet it is hard she sometimes thought that this poor man cannot come to a house which he has legally hired without raising all this speculation i will leave him to himself in spite of what her sister declared and really believed to be her feelings in the expectation of his arrival elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it they were more disturbed more unequal than she had often seen them the subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents about a twelvemonth ago was now brought forward again as soon as ever mr bingley comes my dear said mrs bennet you will wait on him of course no no you forced me into visiting him last year and promised if i went to see him he should marry one of my daughters but it ended in nothing and i will not be sent on a fool s errand again his wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen on his returning to netherfield tis an etiquette i despise said he if he wants our society let him seek it he knows where we live i will not spend my hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back again well all i know is that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him but however that shan t prevent my asking him to dine here i am determined we must have mrs long and the gouldings soon that will make thirteen with ourselves so there will be just room at table for him consoled by this resolution she was the better able to bear her husband s incivility though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see mr bingley in consequence of it before they did as the day of his arrival drew near i begin to be sorry that he comes at all said jane to her sister it would be nothing i could see him with perfect indifference but i can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of my mother means well but she does not know no one can know how much i suffer from what she says happy shall i be when his stay at netherfield is over i wish i could say anything to comfort you replied elizabeth but it is wholly out of my power you must feel it and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me because you have always so much mr bingley arrived mrs bennet through the assistance of servants contrived to have the earliest tidings of it that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side be as long as it could she counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent hopeless of seeing him before but on the third morning after his arrival in hertfordshire she saw him from her dressing room window enter the paddock and ride towards the house her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy jane resolutely kept her place at the table but elizabeth to satisfy her mother went to the window she looked she saw mr darcy with him and sat down again by her sister there is a gentleman with him mamma said kitty who can it be some acquaintance or other my dear i suppose i am sure i do not know la replied kitty it looks just like that man that used to be with him before mr what s his name that tall proud man good gracious mr darcy and so it does i vow well any friend of mr bingley s will always be welcome here to be sure but else i must say that i hate the very sight of him jane looked at elizabeth with surprise and concern she knew but little of their meeting in derbyshire and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter both sisters were uncomfortable enough each felt for the other and of course for themselves and their mother talked on of her dislike of mr darcy and her resolution to be civil to him only as mr bingley s friend without being heard by either of them but elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not yet be suspected by jane to whom she had never yet had courage to show mrs gardiner s letter or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him to jane he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused and whose merits she had undervalued but to her own more extensive information he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits and whom she regarded herself with an interest if not quite so tender at least as reasonable and just as what jane felt for bingley her astonishment at his coming at his coming to netherfield to longbourn and voluntarily seeking her again was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in derbyshire the colour which had been driven from her face returned for half a minute with an additional glow and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes as she thought for that space of time that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken but she would not be secure let me first see how he behaves said she it will then be early enough for expectation she sat intently at work striving to be composed and without daring to lift up her eyes till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister as the servant was approaching the door jane looked a little paler than usual but more sedate than elizabeth had expected on the gentlemen s appearing her colour increased yet she received them with tolerable ease and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment or any unnecessary complaisance elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow and sat down again to her work with an eagerness which it did not often command she had ventured only one glance at darcy he looked serious as usual and she thought more as he had been used to look in hertfordshire than as she had seen him at pemberley but perhaps he could not in her mother s presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt it was a painful but not an improbable conjecture bingley she had likewise seen for an instant and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed he was received by mrs bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her courtesy and address of his friend elizabeth particularly who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied darcy after inquiring of her how mr and mrs gardiner did a question which she could not answer without confusion said scarcely anything he was not seated by her perhaps that was the reason of his silence but it had not been so in derbyshire there he had talked to her friends when he could not to herself but now several minutes elapsed without bringing the sound of his voice and when occasionally unable to resist the impulse of curiosity she raised her eyes to his face she as often found him looking at jane as at herself and frequently on no object but the ground more thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please than when they last met were plainly expressed she was disappointed and angry with herself for being so could i expect it to be otherwise said she yet why did he come she was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself and to him she had hardly courage to speak she inquired after his sister but could do no more it is a long time mr bingley since you went away said mrs bennet he readily agreed to it i began to be afraid you would never come back again people did say you meant to quit the place entirely at michaelmas but however i hope it is not true a great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood since you went away miss lucas is married and settled and one of my own daughters i suppose you have heard of it indeed you must have seen it in the papers it was in the times and the courier i know though it was not put in as it ought to be it was only said lately george wickham esq to miss lydia bennet without there being a syllable said of her father or the place where she lived or anything it was my brother gardiner s drawing up too and i wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it did you see it bingley replied that he did and made his congratulations elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes how mr darcy looked therefore she could not tell it is a delightful thing to be sure to have a daughter well married continued her mother but at the same time mr bingley it is very hard to have her taken away from me they are gone down to newcastle a place quite northward it seems and there they are to stay i do not know how long his regiment is there for i suppose you have heard of his leaving the shire and of his being gone into the regulars thank heaven he has some friends though perhaps not so many as he deserves elizabeth who knew this to be levelled at mr darcy was in such misery of shame that she could hardly keep her seat it drew from her however the exertion of speaking which nothing else had so effectually done before and she asked bingley whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present a few weeks he believed when you have killed all your own birds mr bingley said her mother i beg you will come here and shoot as many as you please on mr bennet s manor i am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you and will save all the best of the coveys for you elizabeth s misery increased at such unnecessary such officious attention were the same fair prospect to arise at present as had flattered them a year ago everything she was persuaded would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion at that instant she felt that years of happiness could not make jane or herself amends for moments of such painful confusion the first wish of my heart said she to herself is never more to be in company with either of them their society can afford no pleasure that will atone for such wretchedness as this let me never see either one or the other again yet the misery for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation received soon afterwards material relief from observing how much the beauty of her sister rekindled the admiration of her former lover when first he came in he had spoken to her but little but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention he found her as handsome as she had been last year as good natured and as unaffected though not quite so chatty jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever but her mind was so busily engaged that she did not always know when she was silent when the gentlemen rose to go away mrs bennet was mindful of her intended civility and they were invited and engaged to dine at longbourn in a few days time you are quite a visit in my debt mr bingley she added for when you went to town last winter you promised to take a family dinner with us as soon as you returned i have not forgot you see and i assure you i was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement bingley looked a little silly at this reflection and said something of his concern at having been prevented by business they then went away mrs bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there that day but though she always kept a very good table she did not think anything less than two courses could be good enough for a man on whom she had such anxious designs or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a year illustration jane happened to look round chapter liv illustration as soon as they were gone elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits or in other words to dwell without interruption on those subjects which must deaden them more mr darcy s behaviour astonished and vexed her why if he came only to be silent grave and indifferent said she did he come at all she could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure he could be still amiable still pleasing to my uncle and aunt when he was in town and why not to me if he fears me why come hither if he no longer cares for me why silent teasing teasing man i will think no more about him her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister who joined her with a cheerful look which showed her better satisfied with their visitors than elizabeth now said she that this first meeting is over i feel perfectly easy i know my own strength and i shall never be embarrassed again by his coming i am glad he dines here on tuesday it will then be publicly seen that on both sides we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance yes very indifferent indeed said elizabeth laughingly oh jane take care my dear lizzy you cannot think me so weak as to be in danger now i think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever they did not see the gentlemen again till tuesday and mrs bennet in the meanwhile was giving way to all the happy schemes which the good humour and common politeness of bingley in half an hour s visit had revived on tuesday there was a large party assembled at longbourn and the two who were most anxiously expected to the credit of their punctuality as sportsmen were in very good time when they repaired to the dining room elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether bingley would take the place which in all their former parties had belonged to him by her sister her prudent mother occupied by the same ideas forbore to invite him to sit by herself on entering the room he seemed to hesitate but jane happened to look round and happened to smile it was decided he placed himself by her elizabeth with a triumphant sensation looked towards his friend he bore it with noble indifference and she would have imagined that bingley had received his sanction to be happy had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards mr darcy with an expression of half laughing alarm his behaviour to her sister was such during dinnertime as showed an admiration of her which though more guarded than formerly persuaded elizabeth that if left wholly to himself jane s happiness and his own would be speedily secured though she dared not depend upon the consequence she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour it gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast for she was in no cheerful humour mr darcy was almost as far from her as the table could divide them he was on one side of her mother she knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either or make either appear to advantage she was not near enough to hear any of their discourse but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other and how formal and cold was their manner whenever they did her mother s ungraciousness made the sense of what they owed him more painful to elizabeth s mind and she would at times have given anything to be privileged to tell him that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family she was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together that the whole of the visit would not pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance anxious and uneasy the period which passed in the drawing room before the gentlemen came was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her uncivil she looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend if he does not come to me then said she i shall give him up for ever the gentlemen came and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes but alas the ladies had crowded round the table where miss bennet was making tea and elizabeth pouring out the coffee in so close a confederacy that there was not a single vacancy near her which would admit of a chair and on the gentlemen s approaching one of the girls moved closer to her than ever and said in a whisper the men shan t come and part us i am determined we want none of them do we darcy had walked away to another part of the room she followed him with her eyes envied everyone to whom he spoke had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee and then was enraged against herself for being so silly a man who has once been refused how could i ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love is there one among the sex who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman there is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings she was a little revived however by his bringing back his coffee cup himself and she seized the opportunity of saying is your sister at pemberley still yes she will remain there till christmas and quite alone have all her friends left her mrs annesley is with her the others have been gone on to scarborough these three weeks she could think of nothing more to say but if he wished to converse with her he might have better success he stood by her however for some minutes in silence and at last on the young lady s whispering to elizabeth again he walked away when the tea things were removed and the card tables placed the ladies all rose and elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him when all her views were overthrown by seeing him fall a victim to her mother s rapacity for whist players and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party she now lost every expectation of pleasure they were confined for the evening at different tables and she had nothing to hope but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself mrs bennet had designed to keep the two netherfield gentlemen to supper but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others and she had no opportunity of detaining them well girls said she as soon as they were left to themselves what say you to the day i think everything has passed off uncommonly well i assure you the dinner was as well dressed as any i ever saw the venison was roasted to a turn and everybody said they never saw so fat a haunch the soup was fifty times better than what we had at the lucases last week and even mr darcy acknowledged that the partridges were remarkably well done and i suppose he has two or three french cooks at least and my dear jane i never saw you look in greater beauty mrs long said so too for i asked her whether you did not and what do you think she said besides ah mrs bennet we shall have her at netherfield at last she did indeed i do think mrs long is as good a creature as ever lived and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls and not at all handsome i like them prodigiously illustration m rs long and her nieces mrs bennet in short was in very great spirits she had seen enough of bingley s behaviour to jane to be convinced that she would get him at last and her expectations of advantage to her family when in a happy humour were so far beyond reason that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day to make his proposals it has been a very agreeable day said miss bennet to elizabeth the party seemed so well selected so suitable one with the other i hope we may often meet again elizabeth smiled lizzy you must not do so you must not suspect me it mortifies me i assure you that i have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man without having a wish beyond it i am perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are that he never had any design of engaging my affection it is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address and a stronger desire of generally pleasing than any other man you are very cruel said her sister you will not let me smile and are provoking me to it every moment how hard it is in some cases to be believed and how impossible in others but why should you wish to persuade me that i feel more than i acknowledge that is a question which i hardly know how to answer we all love to instruct though we can teach only what is not worth knowing forgive me and if you persist in indifference do not make me your confidante illustration lizzy my dear i want to speak to you chapter lv illustration a few days after this visit mr bingley called again and alone his friend had left him that morning for london but was to return home in ten days time he sat with them above an hour and was in remarkably good spirits mrs bennet invited him to dine with them but with many expressions of concern he confessed himself engaged elsewhere next time you call said she i hope we shall be more lucky he should be particularly happy at any time etc etc and if she would give him leave would take an early opportunity of waiting on them can you come to morrow yes he had no engagement at all for to morrow and her invitation was accepted with alacrity he came and in such very good time that the ladies were none of them dressed in ran mrs bennet to her daughters room in her dressing gown and with her hair half finished crying out my dear jane make haste and hurry down he is come mr bingley is come he is indeed make haste make haste here sarah come to miss bennet this moment and help her on with her gown never mind miss lizzy s hair we will be down as soon as we can said jane but i dare say kitty is forwarder than either of us for she went upstairs half an hour ago oh hang kitty what has she to do with it come be quick be quick where is your sash my dear but when her mother was gone jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters the same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the evening after tea mr bennet retired to the library as was his custom and mary went upstairs to her instrument two obstacles of the five being thus removed mrs bennet sat looking and winking at elizabeth and catherine for a considerable time without making any impression on them elizabeth would not observe her and when at last kitty did she very innocently said what is the matter mamma what do you keep winking at me for what am i to do nothing child nothing i did not wink at you she then sat still five minutes longer but unable to waste such a precious occasion she suddenly got up and saying to kitty come here my love i want to speak to you took her out of the room jane instantly gave a look at elizabeth which spoke her distress at such premeditation and her entreaty that she would not give in to it in a few minutes mrs bennet half opened the door and called out lizzy my dear i want to speak with you elizabeth was forced to go we may as well leave them by themselves you know said her mother as soon as she was in the hall kitty and i are going upstairs to sit in my dressing room elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother but remained quietly in the hall till she and kitty were out of sight then returned into the drawing room mrs bennet s schemes for this day were ineffectual bingley was everything that was charming except the professed lover of her daughter his ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party and he bore with the ill judged officiousness of the mother and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to the daughter he scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper and before he went away an engagement was formed chiefly through his own and mrs bennet s means for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband after this day jane said no more of her indifference not a word passed between the sisters concerning bingley but elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded unless mr darcy returned within the stated time seriously however she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman s concurrence bingley was punctual to his appointment and he and mr bennet spent the morning together as had been agreed on the latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected there was nothing of presumption or folly in bingley that could provoke his ridicule or disgust him into silence and he was more communicative and less eccentric than the other had ever seen him bingley of course returned with him to dinner and in the evening mrs bennet s invention was again at work to get everybody away from him and her daughter elizabeth who had a letter to write went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea for as the others were all going to sit down to cards she could not be wanted to counteract her mother s schemes but on her returning to the drawing room when her letter was finished she saw to her infinite surprise there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her on opening the door she perceived her sister and bingley standing together over the hearth as if engaged in earnest conversation and had this led to no suspicion the faces of both as they hastily turned round and moved away from each other would have told it all their situation was awkward enough but hers she thought was still worse not a syllable was uttered by either and elizabeth was on the point of going away again when bingley who as well as the other had sat down suddenly rose and whispering a few words to her sister ran out of the room jane could have no reserves from elizabeth where confidence would give pleasure and instantly embracing her acknowledged with the liveliest emotion that she was the happiest creature in the world tis too much she added by far too much i do not deserve it oh why is not everybody as happy elizabeth s congratulations were given with a sincerity a warmth a delight which words could but poorly express every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to jane but she would not allow herself to stay with her sister or say half that remained to be said for the present i must go instantly to my mother she cried i would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude or allow her to hear it from anyone but myself he is gone to my father already oh lizzy to know that what i have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family how shall i bear so much happiness she then hastened away to her mother who had purposely broken up the card party and was sitting upstairs with kitty elizabeth who was left by herself now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation and this said she is the end of all his friend s anxious circumspection of all his sister s falsehood and contrivance the happiest wisest and most reasonable end in a few minutes she was joined by bingley whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose where is your sister said he hastily as he opened the door with my mother upstairs she will be down in a moment i dare say he then shut the door and coming up to her claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship they shook hands with great cordiality and then till her sister came down she had to listen to all he had to say of his own happiness and of jane s perfections and in spite of his being a lover elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity to be rationally founded because they had for basis the excellent understanding and super excellent disposition of jane and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself it was an evening of no common delight to them all the satisfaction of miss bennet s mind gave such a glow of sweet animation to her face as made her look handsomer than ever kitty simpered and smiled and hoped her turn was coming soon mrs bennet could not give her consent or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings though she talked to bingley of nothing else for half an hour and when mr bennet joined them at supper his voice and manner plainly showed how really happy he was not a word however passed his lips in allusion to it till their visitor took his leave for the night but as soon as he was gone he turned to his daughter and said jane i congratulate you you will be a very happy woman jane went to him instantly kissed him and thanked him for his goodness you are a good girl he replied and i have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled i have not a doubt of your doing very well together your tempers are by no means unlike you are each of you so complying that nothing will ever be resolved on so easy that every servant will cheat you and so generous that you will always exceed your income i hope not so imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be unpardonable in me exceed their income my dear mr bennet cried his wife what are you talking of why he has four or five thousand a year and very likely more then addressing her daughter oh my dear dear jane i am so happy i am sure i shan t get a wink of sleep all night i knew how it would be i always said it must be so at last i was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing i remember as soon as ever i saw him when he first came into hertfordshire last year i thought how likely it was that you should come together oh he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen wickham lydia were all forgotten jane was beyond competition her favourite child at that moment she cared for no other her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense mary petitioned for the use of the library at netherfield and kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter bingley from this time was of course a daily visitor at longbourn coming frequently before breakfast and always remaining till after supper unless when some barbarous neighbour who could not be enough detested had given him an invitation to dinner which he thought himself obliged to accept elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister for while he was present jane had no attention to bestow on anyone else but she found herself considerably useful to both of them in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur in the absence of jane he always attached himself to elizabeth for the pleasure of talking of her and when bingley was gone jane constantly sought the same means of relief he has made me so happy said she one evening by telling me that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring i had not believed it possible i suspected as much replied elizabeth but how did he account for it it must have been his sisters doing they were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me which i cannot wonder at since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects but when they see as i trust they will that their brother is happy with me they will learn to be contented and we shall be on good terms again though we can never be what we once were to each other that is the most unforgiving speech said elizabeth that i ever heard you utter good girl it would vex me indeed to see you again the dupe of miss bingley s pretended regard would you believe it lizzy that when he went to town last november he really loved me and nothing but a persuasion of my being indifferent would have prevented his coming down again he made a little mistake to be sure but it is to the credit of his modesty this naturally introduced a panegyric from jane on his diffidence and the little value he put on his own good qualities elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend for though jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him i am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed cried jane oh lizzy why am i thus singled from my family and blessed above them all if i could but see you as happy if there were but such another man for you if you were to give me forty such men i never could be so happy as you till i have your disposition your goodness i never can have your happiness no no let me shift for myself and perhaps if i have very good luck i may meet with another mr collins in time the situation of affairs in the longbourn family could not be long a secret mrs bennet was privileged to whisper it to mrs philips and she ventured without any permission to do the same by all her neighbours in meryton the bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the world though only a few weeks before when lydia had first run away they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune illustration chapter lvi illustration one morning about a week after bingley s engagement with jane had been formed as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the dining room their attention was suddenly drawn to the window by the sound of a carriage and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn it was too early in the morning for visitors and besides the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours the horses were post and neither the carriage nor the livery of the servant who preceded it were familiar to them as it was certain however that somebody was coming bingley instantly prevailed on miss bennet to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion and walk away with him into the shrubbery they both set off and the conjectures of the remaining three continued though with little satisfaction till the door was thrown open and their visitor entered it was lady catherine de bourgh they were of course all intending to be surprised but their astonishment was beyond their expectation and on the part of mrs bennet and kitty though she was perfectly unknown to them even inferior to what elizabeth felt she entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious made no other reply to elizabeth s salutation than a slight inclination of the head and sat down without saying a word elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother on her ladyship s entrance though no request of introduction had been made mrs bennet all amazement though flattered by having a guest of such high importance received her with the utmost politeness after sitting for a moment in silence she said very stiffly to elizabeth i hope you are well miss bennet that lady i suppose is your mother elizabeth replied very concisely that she was and that i suppose is one of your sisters yes madam said mrs bennet delighted to speak to a lady catherine she is my youngest girl but one my youngest of all is lately married and my eldest is somewhere about the ground walking with a young man who i believe will soon become a part of the family you have a very small park here returned lady catherine after a short silence it is nothing in comparison of rosings my lady i dare say but i assure you it is much larger than sir william lucas s this must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening in summer the windows are full west mrs bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner and then added may i take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left mr and mrs collins well yes very well i saw them the night before last elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from charlotte as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling but no letter appeared and she was completely puzzled mrs bennet with great civility begged her ladyship to take some refreshment but lady catherine very resolutely and not very politely declined eating anything and then rising up said to elizabeth miss bennet there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn i should be glad to take a turn in it if you will favour me with your company go my dear cried her mother and show her ladyship about the different walks i think she will be pleased with the hermitage elizabeth obeyed and running into her own room for her parasol attended her noble guest downstairs as they passed through the hall lady catherine opened the doors into the dining parlour and drawing room and pronouncing them after a short survey to be decent looking rooms walked on her carriage remained at the door and elizabeth saw that her waiting woman was in it they proceeded in silence along the gravel walk that led to the copse elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable illustration after a short survey copyright by george allen how could i ever think her like her nephew said she as she looked in her face as soon as they entered the copse lady catherine began in the following manner you can be at no loss miss bennet to understand the reason of my journey hither your own heart your own conscience must tell you why i come elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment indeed you are mistaken madam i have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here miss bennet replied her ladyship in an angry tone you ought to know that i am not to be trifled with but however insincere you may choose to be you shall not find me so my character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness and in a cause of such moment as this i shall certainly not depart from it a report of a most alarming nature reached me two days ago i was told that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married but that you that miss elizabeth bennet would in all likelihood be soon afterwards united to my nephew my own nephew mr darcy though i know it must be a scandalous falsehood though i would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible i instantly resolved on setting off for this place that i might make my sentiments known to you if you believed it impossible to be true said elizabeth colouring with astonishment and disdain i wonder you took the trouble of coming so far what could your ladyship propose by it at once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted your coming to longbourn to see me and my family said elizabeth coolly will be rather a confirmation of it if indeed such a report is in existence if do you then pretend to be ignorant of it has it not been industriously circulated by yourselves do you not know that such a report is spread abroad i never heard that it was and can you likewise declare that there is no foundation for it i do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship you may ask questions which i shall not choose to answer this is not to be borne miss bennet i insist on being satisfied has he has my nephew made you an offer of marriage your ladyship has declared it to be impossible it ought to be so it must be so while he retains the use of his reason but your arts and allurements may in a moment of infatuation have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family you may have drawn him in if i have i shall be the last person to confess it miss bennet do you know who i am i have not been accustomed to such language as this i am almost the nearest relation he has in the world and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns but you are not entitled to know mine nor will such behaviour as this ever induce me to be explicit let me be rightly understood this match to which you have the presumption to aspire can never take place no never mr darcy is engaged to my daughter now what have you to say only this that if he is so you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me lady catherine hesitated for a moment and then replied the engagement between them is of a peculiar kind from their infancy they have been intended for each other it was the favourite wish of his mother as well as of hers while in their cradles we planned the union and now at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished is their marriage to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth of no importance in the world and wholly unallied to the family do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends to his tacit engagement with miss de bourgh are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy have you not heard me say that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin yes and i had heard it before but what is that to me if there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew i shall certainly not be kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry miss de bourgh you both did as much as you could in planning the marriage its completion depended on others if mr darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin why is not he to make another choice and if i am that choice why may not i accept him because honour decorum prudence nay interest forbid it yes miss bennet interest for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all you will be censured slighted and despised by everyone connected with him your alliance will be a disgrace your name will never even be mentioned by any of us these are heavy misfortunes replied elizabeth but the wife of mr darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation that she could upon the whole have no cause to repine obstinate headstrong girl i am ashamed of you is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring is nothing due to me on that score let us sit down you are to understand miss bennet that i came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose nor will i be dissuaded from it i have not been used to submit to any person s whims i have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment that will make your ladyship s situation at present more pitiable but it will have no effect on me i will not be interrupted hear me in silence my daughter and my nephew are formed for each other they are descended on the maternal side from the same noble line and on the father s from respectable honourable and ancient though untitled families their fortune on both sides is splendid they are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their respective houses and what is to divide them the upstart pretensions of a young woman without family connections or fortune is this to be endured but it must not shall not be if you were sensible of your own good you would not wish to quit the sphere in which you have been brought up in marrying your nephew i should not consider myself as quitting that sphere he is a gentleman i am a gentleman s daughter so far we are equal true you are a gentleman s daughter but what was your mother who are your uncles and aunts do not imagine me ignorant of their condition whatever my connections may be said elizabeth if your nephew does not object to them they can be nothing to you tell me once for all are you engaged to him though elizabeth would not for the mere purpose of obliging lady catherine have answered this question she could not but say after a moment s deliberation i am not lady catherine seemed pleased and will you promise me never to enter into such an engagement i will make no promise of the kind miss bennet i am shocked and astonished i expected to find a more reasonable young woman but do not deceive yourself into a belief that i will ever recede i shall not go away till you have given me the assurance i require and i certainly never shall give it i am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable your ladyship wants mr darcy to marry your daughter but would my giving you the wished for promise make their marriage at all more probable supposing him to be attached to me would my refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin allow me to say lady catherine that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the application was ill judged you have widely mistaken my character if you think i can be worked on by such persuasions as these how far your nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs i cannot tell but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine i must beg therefore to be importuned no further on the subject not so hasty if you please i have by no means done to all the objections i have already urged i have still another to add i am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister s infamous elopement i know it all that the young man s marrying her was a patched up business at the expense of your father and uncle and is such a girl to be my nephew s sister is her husband who is the son of his late father s steward to be his brother heaven and earth of what are you thinking are the shades of pemberley to be thus polluted you can now have nothing further to say she resentfully answered you have insulted me in every possible method i must beg to return to the house and she rose as she spoke lady catherine rose also and they turned back her ladyship was highly incensed you have no regard then for the honour and credit of my nephew unfeeling selfish girl do you not consider that a connection with you must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody lady catherine i have nothing further to say you know my sentiments you are then resolved to have him i have said no such thing i am only resolved to act in that manner which will in my own opinion constitute my happiness without reference to you or to any person so wholly unconnected with me it is well you refuse then to oblige me you refuse to obey the claims of duty honour and gratitude you are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends and make him the contempt of the world neither duty nor honour nor gratitude replied elizabeth has any possible claim on me in the present instance no principle of either would be violated by my marriage with mr darcy and with regard to the resentment of his family or the indignation of the world if the former were excited by his marrying me it would not give me one moment s concern and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn and this is your real opinion this is your final resolve very well i shall now know how to act do not imagine miss bennet that your ambition will ever be gratified i came to try you i hoped to find you reasonable but depend upon it i will carry my point in this manner lady catherine talked on till they were at the door of the carriage when turning hastily round she added i take no leave of you miss bennet i send no compliments to your mother you deserve no such attention i am most seriously displeased elizabeth made no answer and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house walked quietly into it herself she heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded upstairs her mother impatiently met her at the door of her dressing room to ask why lady catherine would not come in again and rest herself she did not choose it said her daughter she would go she is a very fine looking woman and her calling here was prodigiously civil for she only came i suppose to tell us the collinses were well she is on her road somewhere i dare say and so passing through meryton thought she might as well call on you i suppose she had nothing particular to say to you lizzy elizabeth was forced to give in to a little falsehood here for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible illustration but now it comes out chapter lvii illustration the discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw elizabeth into could not be easily overcome nor could she for many hours learn to think of it less than incessantly lady catherine it appeared had actually taken the trouble of this journey from rosings for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with mr darcy it was a rational scheme to be sure but from what the report of their engagement could originate elizabeth was at a loss to imagine till she recollected that his being the intimate friend of bingley and her being the sister of jane was enough at a time when the expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another to supply the idea she had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together and her neighbours at lucas lodge therefore for through their communication with the collinses the report she concluded had reached lady catherine had only set that down as almost certain and immediate which she had looked forward to as possible at some future time in revolving lady catherine s expressions however she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference from what she had said of her resolution to prevent the marriage it occurred to elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew and how he might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her she dared not pronounce she knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt or his dependence on her judgment but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could do and it was certain that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with one whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own his aunt would address him on his weakest side with his notions of dignity he would probably feel that the arguments which to elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous contained much good sense and solid reasoning if he had been wavering before as to what he should do which had often seemed likely the advice and entreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity unblemished could make him in that case he would return no more lady catherine might see him in her way through town and his engagement to bingley of coming again to netherfield must give way if therefore an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his friend within a few days she added i shall know how to understand it i shall then give over every expectation every wish of his constancy if he is satisfied with only regretting me when he might have obtained my affections and hand i shall soon cease to regret him at all the surprise of the rest of the family on hearing who their visitor had been was very great but they obligingly satisfied it with the same kind of supposition which had appeased mrs bennet s curiosity and elizabeth was spared from much teasing on the subject the next morning as she was going down stairs she was met by her father who came out of his library with a letter in his hand lizzy said he i was going to look for you come into my room she followed him thither and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held it suddenly struck her that it might be from lady catherine and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations she followed her father to the fireplace and they both sat down he then said i have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly as it principally concerns yourself you ought to know its contents i did not know before that i had two daughters on the brink of matrimony let me congratulate you on a very important conquest the colour now rushed into elizabeth s cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew instead of the aunt and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself when her father continued you look conscious young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these but i think i may defy even your sagacity to discover the name of your admirer this letter is from mr collins from mr collins and what can he have to say something very much to the purpose of course he begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter of which it seems he has been told by some of the good natured gossiping lucases i shall not sport with your impatience by reading what he says on that point what relates to yourself is as follows having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of mrs collins and myself on this happy event let me now add a short hint on the subject of another of which we have been advertised by the same authority your daughter elizabeth it is presumed will not long bear the name of bennet after her eldest sister has resigned it and the chosen partner of her fate may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages in this land can you possibly guess lizzy who is meant by this this young gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way with everything the heart of mortal can most desire splendid property noble kindred and extensive patronage yet in spite of all these temptations let me warn my cousin elizabeth and yourself of what evils you may incur by a precipitate closure with this gentleman s proposals which of course you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of have you any idea lizzy who this gentleman is but now it comes out my motive for cautioning you is as follows we have reason to imagine that his aunt lady catherine de bourgh does not look on the match with a friendly eye mr darcy you see is the man now lizzy i think i have surprised you could he or the lucases have pitched on any man within the circle of our acquaintance whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related mr darcy who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish and who probably never looked at you in his life it is admirable elizabeth tried to join in her father s pleasantry but could only force one most reluctant smile never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her are you not diverted oh yes pray read on after mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night she immediately with her usual condescension expressed what she felt on the occasion when it became apparent that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match i thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned mr collins moreover adds i am truly rejoiced that my cousin lydia s sad business has been so well hushed up and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place should be so generally known i must not however neglect the duties of my station or refrain from declaring my amazement at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married it was an encouragement of vice and had i been the rector of longbourn i should very strenuously have opposed it you ought certainly to forgive them as a christian but never to admit them in your sight or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing that is his notion of christian forgiveness the rest of his letter is only about his dear charlotte s situation and his expectation of a young olive branch but lizzy you look as if you did not enjoy it you are not going to be missish i hope and pretend to be affronted at an idle report for what do we live but to make sport for our neighbours and laugh at them in our turn oh cried elizabeth i am exceedingly diverted but it is so strange yes that is what makes it amusing had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing but his perfect indifference and your pointed dislike make it so delightfully absurd much as i abominate writing i would not give up mr collins s correspondence for any consideration nay when i read a letter of his i cannot help giving him the preference even over wickham much as i value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son in law and pray lizzy what said lady catherine about this report did she call to refuse her consent to this question his daughter replied only with a laugh and as it had been asked without the least suspicion she was not distressed by his repeating it elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not it was necessary to laugh when she would rather have cried her father had most cruelly mortified her by what he said of mr darcy s indifference and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration or fear that perhaps instead of his seeing too little she might have fancied too much illustration the efforts of his aunt copyright by george allen chapter lviii illustration instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend as elizabeth half expected mr bingley to do he was able to bring darcy with him to longbourn before many days had passed after lady catherine s visit the gentlemen arrived early and before mrs bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt of which her daughter sat in momentary dread bingley who wanted to be alone with jane proposed their all walking out it was agreed to mrs bennet was not in the habit of walking mary could never spare time but the remaining five set off together bingley and jane however soon allowed the others to outstrip them they lagged behind while elizabeth kitty and darcy were to entertain each other very little was said by either kitty was too much afraid of him to talk elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution and perhaps he might be doing the same they walked towards the lucases because kitty wished to call upon maria and as elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern when kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone now was the moment for her resolution to be executed and while her courage was high she immediately said mr darcy i am a very selfish creature and for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings care not how much i may be wounding yours i can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister ever since i have known it i have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully i feel it were it known to the rest of my family i should not have merely my own gratitude to express i am sorry exceedingly sorry replied darcy in a tone of surprise and emotion that you have ever been informed of what may in a mistaken light have given you uneasiness i did not think mrs gardiner was so little to be trusted you must not blame my aunt lydia s thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter and of course i could not rest till i knew the particulars let me thank you again and again in the name of all my family for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble and bear so many mortifications for the sake of discovering them if you will thank me he replied let it be for yourself alone that the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other inducements which led me on i shall not attempt to deny but your family owe me nothing much as i respect them i believe i thought only of you elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word after a short pause her companion added you are too generous to trifle with me if your feelings are still what they were last april tell me so at once my affections and wishes are unchanged but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation now forced herself to speak and immediately though not very fluently gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone so material a change since the period to which he alluded as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances the happiness which this reply produced was such as he had probably never felt before and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do had elizabeth been able to encounter his eyes she might have seen how well the expression of heartfelt delight diffused over his face became him but though she could not look she could listen and he told her of feelings which in proving of what importance she was to him made his affection every moment more valuable they walked on without knowing in what direction there was too much to be thought and felt and said for attention to any other objects she soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt who did call on him in her return through london and there relate her journey to longbourn its motive and the substance of her conversation with elizabeth dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter which in her ladyship s apprehension peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew which she had refused to give but unluckily for her ladyship its effect had been exactly contrariwise it taught me to hope said he as i had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before i knew enough of your disposition to be certain that had you been absolutely irrevocably decided against me you would have acknowledged it to lady catherine frankly and openly elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied yes you know enough of my frankness to believe me capable of that after abusing you so abominably to your face i could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations what did you say of me that i did not deserve for though your accusations were ill founded formed on mistaken premises my behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof it was unpardonable i cannot think of it without abhorrence we will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening said elizabeth the conduct of neither if strictly examined will be irreproachable but since then we have both i hope improved in civility i cannot be so easily reconciled to myself the recollection of what i then said of my conduct my manners my expressions during the whole of it is now and has been many months inexpressibly painful to me your reproof so well applied i shall never forget had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner those were your words you know not you can scarcely conceive how they have tortured me though it was some time i confess before i was reasonable enough to allow their justice i was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression i had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way i can easily believe it you thought me then devoid of every proper feeling i am sure you did the turn of your countenance i shall never forget as you said that i could not have addressed you in any possible way that would induce you to accept me oh do not repeat what i then said these recollections will not do at all i assure you that i have long been most heartily ashamed of it darcy mentioned his letter did it said he did it soon make you think better of me did you on reading it give any credit to its contents she explained what its effects on her had been and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed i knew said he that what i wrote must give you pain but it was necessary i hope you have destroyed the letter there was one part especially the opening of it which i should dread your having the power of reading again i can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me the letter shall certainly be burnt if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard but though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable they are not i hope quite so easily changed as that implies when i wrote that letter replied darcy i believed myself perfectly calm and cool but i am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit the letter perhaps began in bitterness but it did not end so the adieu is charity itself but think no more of the letter the feelings of the person who wrote and the person who received it are now so widely different from what they were then that every unpleasant circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten you must learn some of my philosophy think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure i cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind your retrospections must be so totally void of reproach that the contentment arising from them is not of philosophy but what is much better of ignorance but with me it is not so painful recollections will intrude which cannot which ought not to be repelled i have been a selfish being all my life in practice though not in principle as a child i was taught what was right but i was not taught to correct my temper i was given good principles but left to follow them in pride and conceit unfortunately an only son for many years an only child i was spoiled by my parents who though good themselves my father particularly all that was benevolent and amiable allowed encouraged almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing to care for none beyond my own family circle to think meanly of all the rest of the world to wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own such i was from eight to eight and twenty and such i might still have been but for you dearest loveliest elizabeth what do i not owe you you taught me a lesson hard indeed at first but most advantageous by you i was properly humbled i came to you without a doubt of my reception you showed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased had you then persuaded yourself that i should indeed i had what will you think of my vanity i believed you to be wishing expecting my addresses my manners must have been in fault but not intentionally i assure you i never meant to deceive you but my spirits might often lead me wrong how you must have hated me after that evening hate you i was angry perhaps at first but my anger soon began to take a proper direction i am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me when we met at pemberley you blamed me for coming no indeed i felt nothing but surprise your surprise could not be greater than mine in being noticed by you my conscience told me that i deserved no extraordinary politeness and i confess that i did not expect to receive more than my due my object then replied darcy was to show you by every civility in my power that i was not so mean as to resent the past and i hoped to obtain your forgiveness to lessen your ill opinion by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to how soon any other wishes introduced themselves i can hardly tell but i believe in about half an hour after i had seen you he then told her of georgiana s delight in her acquaintance and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed before he quitted the inn and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend she expressed her gratitude again but it was too painful a subject to each to be dwelt on farther after walking several miles in a leisurely manner and too busy to know anything about it they found at last on examining their watches that it was time to be at home what could have become of mr bingley and jane was a wonder which introduced the discussion of their affairs darcy was delighted with their engagement his friend had given him the earliest information of it i must ask whether you were surprised said elizabeth not at all when i went away i felt that it would soon happen that is to say you had given your permission i guessed as much and though he exclaimed at the term she found that it had been pretty much the case on the evening before my going to london said he i made a confession to him which i believe i ought to have made long ago i told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs absurd and impertinent his surprise was great he had never had the slightest suspicion i told him moreover that i believed myself mistaken in supposing as i had done that your sister was indifferent to him and as i could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated i felt no doubt of their happiness together elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend did you speak from your own observation said she when you told him that my sister loved him or merely from my information last spring from the former i had narrowly observed her during the two visits which i had lately made her here and i was convinced of her affection and your assurance of it i suppose carried immediate conviction to him it did bingley is most unaffectedly modest his diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case but his reliance on mine made everything easy i was obliged to confess one thing which for a time and not unjustly offended him i could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter that i had known it and purposely kept it from him he was angry but his anger i am persuaded lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister s sentiments he has heartily forgiven me now elizabeth longed to observe that mr bingley had been a most delightful friend so easily guided that his worth was invaluable but she checked herself she remembered that he had yet to learn to be laughed at and it was rather too early to begin in anticipating the happiness of bingley which of course was to be inferior only to his own he continued the conversation till they reached the house in the hall they parted illustration unable to utter a syllable copyright by george allen chapter lix illustration my dear lizzy where can you have been walking to was a question which elizabeth received from jane as soon as she entered the room and from all the others when they sat down to table she had only to say in reply that they had wandered about till she was beyond her own knowledge she coloured as she spoke but neither that nor anything else awakened a suspicion of the truth the evening passed quietly unmarked by anything extraordinary the acknowledged lovers talked and laughed the unacknowledged were silent darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth and elizabeth agitated and confused rather knew that she was happy than felt herself to be so for besides the immediate embarrassment there were other evils before her she anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known she was aware that no one liked him but jane and even feared that with the others it was a dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away at night she opened her heart to jane though suspicion was very far from miss bennet s general habits she was absolutely incredulous here you are joking lizzy this cannot be engaged to mr darcy no no you shall not deceive me i know it to be impossible this is a wretched beginning indeed my sole dependence was on you and i am sure nobody else will believe me if you do not yet indeed i am in earnest i speak nothing but the truth he still loves me and we are engaged jane looked at her doubtingly oh lizzy it cannot be i know how much you dislike him you know nothing of the matter that is all to be forgot perhaps i did not always love him so well as i do now but in such cases as these a good memory is unpardonable this is the last time i shall ever remember it myself miss bennet still looked all amazement elizabeth again and more seriously assured her of its truth good heaven can it be really so yet now i must believe you cried jane my dear dear lizzy i would i do congratulate you but are you certain forgive the question are you quite certain that you can be happy with him there can be no doubt of that it is settled between us already that we are to be the happiest couple in the world but are you pleased jane shall you like to have such a brother very very much nothing could give either bingley or myself more delight but we considered it we talked of it as impossible and do you really love him quite well enough oh lizzy do anything rather than marry without affection are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do oh yes you will only think i feel more than i ought to do when i tell you all what do you mean why i must confess that i love him better than i do bingley i am afraid you will be angry my dearest sister now be be serious i want to talk very seriously let me know everything that i am to know without delay will you tell me how long you have loved him it has been coming on so gradually that i hardly know when it began but i believe i must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at pemberley another entreaty that she would be serious however produced the desired effect and she soon satisfied jane by her solemn assurances of attachment when convinced on that article miss bennet had nothing further to wish now i am quite happy said she for you will be as happy as myself i always had a value for him were it for nothing but his love of you i must always have esteemed him but now as bingley s friend and your husband there can be only bingley and yourself more dear to me but lizzy you have been very sly very reserved with me how little did you tell me of what passed at pemberley and lambton i owe all that i know of it to another not to you elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy she had been unwilling to mention bingley and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend but now she would no longer conceal from her his share in lydia s marriage all was acknowledged and half the night spent in conversation good gracious cried mrs bennet as she stood at a window the next morning if that disagreeable mr darcy is not coming here again with our dear bingley what can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here i had no notion but he would go a shooting or something or other and not disturb us with his company what shall we do with him lizzy you must walk out with him again that he may not be in bingley s way elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet as soon as they entered bingley looked at her so expressively and shook hands with such warmth as left no doubt of his good information and he soon afterwards said aloud mrs bennet have you no more lanes hereabouts in which lizzy may lose her way again to day i advise mr darcy and lizzy and kitty said mrs bennet to walk to oakham mount this morning it is a nice long walk and mr darcy has never seen the view it may do very well for the others replied mr bingley but i am sure it will be too much for kitty won t it kitty kitty owned that she had rather stay at home darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the mount and elizabeth silently consented as she went upstairs to get ready mrs bennet followed her saying i am quite sorry lizzy that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself but i hope you will not mind it it is all for jane s sake you know and there is no occasion for talking to him except just now and then so do not put yourself to inconvenience during their walk it was resolved that mr bennet s consent should be asked in the course of the evening elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother s she could not determine how her mother would take it sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man but whether she were violently set against the match or violently delighted with it it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense and she could no more bear that mr darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy than the first vehemence of her disapprobation in the evening soon after mr bennet withdrew to the library she saw mr darcy rise also and follow him and her agitation on seeing it was extreme she did not fear her father s opposition but he was going to be made unhappy and that it should be through her means that she his favourite child should be distressing him by her choice should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her was a wretched reflection and she sat in misery till mr darcy appeared again when looking at him she was a little relieved by his smile in a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with kitty and while pretending to admire her work said in a whisper go to your father he wants you in the library she was gone directly her father was walking about the room looking grave and anxious lizzy said he what are you doing are you out of your senses to be accepting this man have not you always hated him how earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable her expressions more moderate it would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give but they were now necessary and she assured him with some confusion of her attachment to mr darcy or in other words you are determined to have him he is rich to be sure and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than jane but will they make you happy have you any other objection said elizabeth than your belief of my indifference none at all we all know him to be a proud unpleasant sort of man but this would be nothing if you really liked him i do i do like him she replied with tears in her eyes i love him indeed he has no improper pride he is perfectly amiable you do not know what he really is then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms lizzy said her father i have given him my consent he is the kind of man indeed to whom i should never dare refuse anything which he condescended to ask i now give it to you if you are resolved on having him but let me advise you to think better of it i know your disposition lizzy i know that you could be neither happy nor respectable unless you truly esteemed your husband unless you looked up to him as a superior your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage you could scarcely escape discredit and misery my child let me not have the grief of seeing you unable to respect your partner in life you know not what you are about elizabeth still more affected was earnest and solemn in her reply and at length by repeated assurances that mr darcy was really the object of her choice by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day but had stood the test of many months suspense and enumerating with energy all his good qualities she did conquer her father s incredulity and reconcile him to the match well my dear said he when she ceased speaking i have no more to say if this be the case he deserves you i could not have parted with you my lizzy to anyone less worthy to complete the favourable impression she then told him what mr darcy had voluntarily done for lydia he heard her with astonishment this is an evening of wonders indeed and so darcy did everything made up the match gave the money paid the fellow s debts and got him his commission so much the better it will save me a world of trouble and economy had it been your uncle s doing i must and would have paid him but these violent young lovers carry everything their own way i shall offer to pay him to morrow he will rant and storm about his love for you and there will be an end of the matter he then recollected her embarrassment a few days before on his reading mr collins s letter and after laughing at her some time allowed her at last to go saying as she quitted the room if any young men come for mary or kitty send them in for i am quite at leisure elizabeth s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight and after half an hour s quiet reflection in her own room she was able to join the others with tolerable composure everything was too recent for gaiety but the evening passed tranquilly away there was no longer anything material to be dreaded and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time when her mother went up to her dressing room at night she followed her and made the important communication its effect was most extraordinary for on first hearing it mrs bennet sat quite still and unable to utter a syllable nor was it under many many minutes that she could comprehend what she heard though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them she began at length to recover to fidget about in her chair get up sit down again wonder and bless herself good gracious lord bless me only think dear me mr darcy who would have thought it and is it really true oh my sweetest lizzy how rich and how great you will be what pin money what jewels what carriages you will have jane s is nothing to it nothing at all i am so pleased so happy such a charming man so handsome so tall oh my dear lizzy pray apologize for my having disliked him so much before i hope he will overlook it dear dear lizzy a house in town everything that is charming three daughters married ten thousand a year oh lord what will become of me i shall go distracted this was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted and elizabeth rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself soon went away but before she had been three minutes in her own room her mother followed her my dearest child she cried i can think of nothing else ten thousand a year and very likely more tis as good as a lord and a special licence you must and shall be married by a special licence but my dearest love tell me what dish mr darcy is particularly fond of that i may have it to morrow this was a sad omen of what her mother s behaviour to the gentleman himself might be and elizabeth found that though in the certain possession of his warmest affection and secure of her relations consent there was still something to be wished for but the morrow passed off much better than she expected for mrs bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son in law that she ventured not to speak to him unless it was in her power to offer him any attention or mark her deference for his opinion elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him and mr bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem i admire all my three sons in law highly said he wickham perhaps is my favourite but i think i shall like your husband quite as well as jane s illustration the obsequious civility copyright by george allen chapter lx illustration elizabeth s spirits soon rising to playfulness again she wanted mr darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her how could you begin said she i can comprehend your going on charmingly when you had once made a beginning but what could set you off in the first place i cannot fix on the hour or the spot or the look or the words which laid the foundation it is too long ago i was in the middle before i knew that i had begun my beauty you had early withstood and as for my manners my behaviour to you was at least always bordering on the uncivil and i never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not now be sincere did you admire me for my impertinence for the liveliness of your mind i did you may as well call it impertinence at once it was very little less the fact is that you were sick of civility of deference of officious attention you were disgusted with the women who were always speaking and looking and thinking for your approbation alone i roused and interested you because i was so unlike them had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself your feelings were always noble and just and in your heart you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you there i have saved you the trouble of accounting for it and really all things considered i begin to think it perfectly reasonable to be sure you know no actual good of me but nobody thinks of that when they fall in love was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to jane while she was ill at netherfield dearest jane who could have done less for her but make a virtue of it by all means my good qualities are under your protection and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible and in return it belongs to me to find occasions for teasing and quarrelling with you as often as may be and i shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last what made you so shy of me when you first called and afterwards dined here why especially when you called did you look as if you did not care about me because you were grave and silent and gave me no encouragement but i was embarrassed and so was i you might have talked to me more when you came to dinner a man who had felt less might how unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give and that i should be so reasonable as to admit it but i wonder how long you would have gone on if you had been left to yourself i wonder when you would have spoken if i had not asked you my resolution of thanking you for your kindness to lydia had certainly great effect too much i am afraid for what becomes of the moral if our comfort springs from a breach of promise for i ought not to have mentioned the subject this will never do you need not distress yourself the moral will be perfectly fair lady catherine s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of removing all my doubts i am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude i was not in a humour to wait for an opening of yours my aunt s intelligence had given me hope and i was determined at once to know everything lady catherine has been of infinite use which ought to make her happy for she loves to be of use but tell me what did you come down to netherfield for was it merely to ride to longbourn and be embarrassed or had you intended any more serious consequences my real purpose was to see you and to judge if i could whether i might ever hope to make you love me my avowed one or what i avowed to myself was to see whether your sister was still partial to bingley and if she were to make the confession to him which i have since made shall you ever have courage to announce to lady catherine what is to befall her i am more likely to want time than courage elizabeth but it ought to be done and if you will give me a sheet of paper it shall be done directly and if i had not a letter to write myself i might sit by you and admire the evenness of your writing as another young lady once did but i have an aunt too who must not be longer neglected from an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with mr darcy had been overrated elizabeth had never yet answered mrs gardiner s long letter but now having that to communicate which she knew would be most welcome she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness and immediately wrote as follows i would have thanked you before my dear aunt as i ought to have done for your long kind satisfactory detail of particulars but to say the truth i was too cross to write you supposed more than really existed but now suppose as much as you choose give a loose to your fancy indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford and unless you believe me actually married you cannot greatly err you must write again very soon and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last i thank you again and again for not going to the lakes how could i be so silly as to wish it your idea of the ponies is delightful we will go round the park every day i am the happiest creature in the world perhaps other people have said so before but no one with such justice i am happier even than jane she only smiles i laugh mr darcy sends you all the love in the world that can be spared from me you are all to come to pemberley at christmas yours etc mr darcy s letter to lady catherine was in a different style and still different from either was what mr bennet sent to mr collins in return for his last dear sir i must trouble you once more for congratulations elizabeth will soon be the wife of mr darcy console lady catherine as well as you can but if i were you i would stand by the nephew he has more to give yours sincerely etc miss bingley s congratulations to her brother on his approaching marriage were all that was affectionate and insincere she wrote even to jane on the occasion to express her delight and repeat all her former professions of regard jane was not deceived but she was affected and though feeling no reliance on her could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved the joy which miss darcy expressed on receiving similar information was as sincere as her brother s in sending it four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister before any answer could arrive from mr collins or any congratulations to elizabeth from his wife the longbourn family heard that the collinses were come themselves to lucas lodge the reason of this sudden removal was soon evident lady catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew s letter that charlotte really rejoicing in the match was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over at such a moment the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to elizabeth though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought when she saw mr darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband he bore it however with admirable calmness he could even listen to sir william lucas when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest jewel of the country and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at st james s with very decent composure if he did shrug his shoulders it was not till sir william was out of sight mrs philips s vulgarity was another and perhaps a greater tax on his forbearance and though mrs philips as well as her sister stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which bingley s good humour encouraged yet whenever she did speak she must be vulgar nor was her respect for him though it made her more quiet at all likely to make her more elegant elizabeth did all she could to shield him from the frequent notice of either and was ever anxious to keep him to herself and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure it added to the hope of the future and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at pemberley illustration chapter lxi illustration happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which mrs bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters with what delighted pride she afterwards visited mrs bingley and talked of mrs darcy may be guessed i wish i could say for the sake of her family that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible amiable well informed woman for the rest of her life though perhaps it was lucky for her husband who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly mr bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly his affection for her drew him oftener from home than anything else could do he delighted in going to pemberley especially when he was least expected mr bingley and jane remained at netherfield only a twelvemonth so near a vicinity to her mother and meryton relations was not desirable even to his easy temper or her affectionate heart the darling wish of his sisters was then gratified he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to derbyshire and jane and elizabeth in addition to every other source of happiness were within thirty miles of each other kitty to her very material advantage spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters in society so superior to what she had generally known her improvement was great she was not of so ungovernable a temper as lydia and removed from the influence of lydia s example she became by proper attention and management less irritable less ignorant and less insipid from the further disadvantage of lydia s society she was of course carefully kept and though mrs wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her with the promise of balls and young men her father would never consent to her going mary was the only daughter who remained at home and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by mrs bennet s being quite unable to sit alone mary was obliged to mix more with the world but she could still moralize over every morning visit and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters beauty and her own it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance as for wickham and lydia their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters he bore with philosophy the conviction that elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her and in spite of everything was not wholly without hope that darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune the congratulatory letter which elizabeth received from lydia on her marriage explained to her that by his wife at least if not by himself such a hope was cherished the letter was to this effect my dear lizzy i wish you joy if you love mr darcy half so well as i do my dear wickham you must be very happy it is a great comfort to have you so rich and when you have nothing else to do i hope you will think of us i am sure wickham would like a place at court very much and i do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help any place would do of about three or four hundred a year but however do not speak to mr darcy about it if you had rather not yours etc as it happened that elizabeth had much rather not she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kind such relief however as it was in her power to afford by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expenses she frequently sent them it had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants and heedless of the future must be very insufficient to their support and whenever they changed their quarters either jane or herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance towards discharging their bills their manner of living even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home was unsettled in the extreme they were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation and always spending more than they ought his affection for her soon sunk into indifference hers lasted a little longer and in spite of her youth and her manners she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her though darcy could never receive him at pemberley yet for elizabeth s sake he assisted him further in his profession lydia was occasionally a visitor there when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in london or bath and with the bingleys they both of them frequently stayed so long that even bingley s good humour was overcome and he proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone miss bingley was very deeply mortified by darcy s marriage but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at pemberley she dropped all her resentment was fonder than ever of georgiana almost as attentive to darcy as heretofore and paid off every arrear of civility to elizabeth pemberley was now georgiana s home and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what darcy had hoped to see they were able to love each other even as well as they intended georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of elizabeth though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively sportive manner of talking to her brother he who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection she now saw the object of open pleasantry her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way by elizabeth s instructions she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself lady catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement she sent him language so very abusive especially of elizabeth that for some time all intercourse was at an end but at length by elizabeth s persuasion he was prevailed on to overlook the offence and seek a reconciliation and after a little further resistance on the part of his aunt her resentment gave way either to her affection for him or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself and she condescended to wait on them at pemberley in spite of that pollution which its woods had received not merely from the presence of such a mistress but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city with the gardiners they were always on the most intimate terms darcy as well as elizabeth really loved them and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who by bringing her into derbyshire had been the means of uniting them illustration the end chiswick press charles whittingham and co tooks court chancery

most recently updated october language english credits an anonymous project gutenberg volunteer and jose menendez start of the project gutenberg ebook the adventures of sherlock holmes the adventures of sherlock holmes by arthur conan doyle contents i a scandal in bohemia ii the red headed league iii a case of identity iv the boscombe valley mystery v the five orange pips vi the man with the twisted lip vii the adventure of the blue carbuncle viii the adventure of the speckled band ix the adventure of the engineer s thumb x the adventure of the noble bachelor xi the adventure of the beryl coronet xii the adventure of the copper beeches i a scandal in bohemia i to sherlock holmes she is always the woman i have seldom heard him mention her under any other name in his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex it was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for irene adler all emotions and that one particularly were abhorrent to his cold precise but admirably balanced mind he was i take it the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen but as a lover he would have placed himself in a false position he never spoke of the softer passions save with a gibe and a sneer they were admirable things for the observer excellent for drawing the veil from men s motives and actions but for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental results grit in a sensitive instrument or a crack in one of his own high power lenses would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his and yet there was but one woman to him and that woman was the late irene adler of dubious and questionable memory i had seen little of holmes lately my marriage had drifted us away from each other my own complete happiness and the home centred interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master of his own establishment were sufficient to absorb all my attention while holmes who loathed every form of society with his whole bohemian soul remained in our lodgings in baker street buried among his old books and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition the drowsiness of the drug and the fierce energy of his own keen nature he was still as ever deeply attracted by the study of crime and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those clues and clearing up those mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police from time to time i heard some vague account of his doings of his summons to odessa in the case of the trepoff murder of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the atkinson brothers at trincomalee and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the reigning family of holland beyond these signs of his activity however which i merely shared with all the readers of the daily press i knew little of my former friend and companion one night it was on the twentieth of march i was returning from a journey to a patient for i had now returned to civil practice when my way led me through baker street as i passed the well remembered door which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing and with the dark incidents of the study in scarlet i was seized with a keen desire to see holmes again and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers his rooms were brilliantly lit and even as i looked up i saw his tall spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against the blind he was pacing the room swiftly eagerly with his head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him to me who knew his every mood and habit his attitude and manner told their own story he was at work again he had risen out of his drug created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem i rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own his manner was not effusive it seldom was but he was glad i think to see me with hardly a word spoken but with a kindly eye he waved me to an armchair threw across his case of cigars and indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner then he stood before the fire and looked me over in his singular introspective fashion wedlock suits you he remarked i think watson that you have put on seven and a half pounds since i saw you seven i answered indeed i should have thought a little more just a trifle more i fancy watson and in practice again i observe you did not tell me that you intended to go into harness then how do you know i see it i deduce it how do i know that you have been getting yourself very wet lately and that you have a most clumsy and careless servant girl my dear holmes said i this is too much you would certainly have been burned had you lived a few centuries ago it is true that i had a country walk on thursday and came home in a dreadful mess but as i have changed my clothes i can t imagine how you deduce it as to mary jane she is incorrigible and my wife has given her notice but there again i fail to see how you work it out he chuckled to himself and rubbed his long nervous hands together it is simplicity itself said he my eyes tell me that on the inside of your left shoe just where the firelight strikes it the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts obviously they have been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it hence you see my double deduction that you had been out in vile weather and that you had a particularly malignant boot slitting specimen of the london slavey as to your practice if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger and a bulge on the right side of his top hat to show where he has secreted his stethoscope i must be dull indeed if i do not pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession i could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his process of deduction when i hear you give your reasons i remarked the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that i could easily do it myself though at each successive instance of your reasoning i am baffled until you explain your process and yet i believe that my eyes are as good as yours quite so he answered lighting a cigarette and throwing himself down into an armchair you see but you do not observe the distinction is clear for example you have frequently seen the steps which lead up from the hall to this room frequently how often well some hundreds of times then how many are there how many i don t know quite so you have not observed and yet you have seen that is just my point now i know that there are seventeen steps because i have both seen and observed by the way since you are interested in these little problems and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences you may be interested in this he threw over a sheet of thick pink tinted notepaper which had been lying open upon the table it came by the last post said he read it aloud the note was undated and without either signature or address there will call upon you to night at a quarter to eight o clock it said a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very deepest moment your recent services to one of the royal houses of europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated this account of you we have from all quarters received be in your chamber then at that hour and do not take it amiss if your visitor wear a mask this is indeed a mystery i remarked what do you imagine that it means i have no data yet it is a capital mistake to theorise before one has data insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories instead of theories to suit facts but the note itself what do you deduce from it i carefully examined the writing and the paper upon which it was written the man who wrote it was presumably well to do i remarked endeavouring to imitate my companion s processes such paper could not be bought under half a crown a packet it is peculiarly strong and stiff peculiar that is the very word said holmes it is not an english paper at all hold it up to the light i did so and saw a large e with a small g a p and a large g with a small t woven into the texture of the paper what do you make of that asked holmes the name of the maker no doubt or his monogram rather not at all the g with the small t stands for gesellschaft which is the german for company it is a customary contraction like our co p of course stands for papier now for the eg let us glance at our continental gazetteer he took down a heavy brown volume from his shelves eglow eglonitz here we are egria it is in a german speaking country in bohemia not far from carlsbad remarkable as being the scene of the death of wallenstein and for its numerous glass factories and paper mills ha ha my boy what do you make of that his eyes sparkled and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud from his cigarette the paper was made in bohemia i said precisely and the man who wrote the note is a german do you note the peculiar construction of the sentence this account of you we have from all quarters received a frenchman or russian could not have written that it is the german who is so uncourteous to his verbs it only remains therefore to discover what is wanted by this german who writes upon bohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask to showing his face and here he comes if i am not mistaken to resolve all our doubts as he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses hoofs and grating wheels against the curb followed by a sharp pull at the bell holmes whistled a pair by the sound said he yes he continued glancing out of the window a nice little brougham and a pair of beauties a hundred and fifty guineas apiece there s money in this case watson if there is nothing else i think that i had better go holmes not a bit doctor stay where you are i am lost without my boswell and this promises to be interesting it would be a pity to miss it but your client never mind him i may want your help and so may he here he comes sit down in that armchair doctor and give us your best attention a slow and heavy step which had been heard upon the stairs and in the passage paused immediately outside the door then there was a loud and authoritative tap come in said holmes a man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches in height with the chest and limbs of a hercules his dress was rich with a richness which would in england be looked upon as akin to bad taste heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and fronts of his double breasted coat while the deep blue cloak which was thrown over his shoulders was lined with flame coloured silk and secured at the neck with a brooch which consisted of a single flaming beryl boots which extended halfway up his calves and which were trimmed at the tops with rich brown fur completed the impression of barbaric opulence which was suggested by his whole appearance he carried a broad brimmed hat in his hand while he wore across the upper part of his face extending down past the cheekbones a black vizard mask which he had apparently adjusted that very moment for his hand was still raised to it as he entered from the lower part of the face he appeared to be a man of strong character with a thick hanging lip and a long straight chin suggestive of resolution pushed to the length of obstinacy you had my note he asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly marked german accent i told you that i would call he looked from one to the other of us as if uncertain which to address pray take a seat said holmes this is my friend and colleague dr watson who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases whom have i the honour to address you may address me as the count von kramm a bohemian nobleman i understand that this gentleman your friend is a man of honour and discretion whom i may trust with a matter of the most extreme importance if not i should much prefer to communicate with you alone i rose to go but holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me back into my chair it is both or none said he you may say before this gentleman anything which you may say to me the count shrugged his broad shoulders then i must begin said he by binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years at the end of that time the matter will be of no importance at present it is not too much to say that it is of such weight it may have an influence upon european history i promise said holmes and i you will excuse this mask continued our strange visitor the august person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to you and i may confess at once that the title by which i have just called myself is not exactly my own i was aware of it said holmes dryly the circumstances are of great delicacy and every precaution has to be taken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal and seriously compromise one of the reigning families of europe to speak plainly the matter implicates the great house of ormstein hereditary kings of bohemia i was also aware of that murmured holmes settling himself down in his armchair and closing his eyes our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid lounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him as the most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in europe holmes slowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his gigantic client if your majesty would condescend to state your case he remarked i should be better able to advise you the man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in uncontrollable agitation then with a gesture of desperation he tore the mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground you are right he cried i am the king why should i attempt to conceal it why indeed murmured holmes your majesty had not spoken before i was aware that i was addressing wilhelm gottsreich sigismond von ormstein grand duke of cassel felstein and hereditary king of bohemia but you can understand said our strange visitor sitting down once more and passing his hand over his high white forehead you can understand that i am not accustomed to doing such business in my own person yet the matter was so delicate that i could not confide it to an agent without putting myself in his power i have come incognito from prague for the purpose of consulting you then pray consult said holmes shutting his eyes once more the facts are briefly these some five years ago during a lengthy visit to warsaw i made the acquaintance of the well known adventuress irene adler the name is no doubt familiar to you kindly look her up in my index doctor murmured holmes without opening his eyes for many years he had adopted a system of docketing all paragraphs concerning men and things so that it was difficult to name a subject or a person on which he could not at once furnish information in this case i found her biography sandwiched in between that of a hebrew rabbi and that of a staff commander who had written a monograph upon the deep sea fishes let me see said holmes hum born in new jersey in the year contralto hum la scala hum prima donna imperial opera of warsaw yes retired from operatic stage ha living in london quite so your majesty as i understand became entangled with this young person wrote her some compromising letters and is now desirous of getting those letters back precisely so but how was there a secret marriage none no legal papers or certificates none then i fail to follow your majesty if this young person should produce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes how is she to prove their authenticity there is the writing pooh pooh forgery my private note paper stolen my own seal imitated my photograph bought we were both in the photograph oh dear that is very bad your majesty has indeed committed an indiscretion i was mad insane you have compromised yourself seriously i was only crown prince then i was young i am but thirty now it must be recovered we have tried and failed your majesty must pay it must be bought she will not sell stolen then five attempts have been made twice burglars in my pay ransacked her house once we diverted her luggage when she travelled twice she has been waylaid there has been no result no sign of it absolutely none holmes laughed it is quite a pretty little problem said he but a very serious one to me returned the king reproachfully very indeed and what does she propose to do with the photograph to ruin me but how i am about to be married so i have heard to clotilde lothman von saxe meningen second daughter of the king of scandinavia you may know the strict principles of her family she is herself the very soul of delicacy a shadow of a doubt as to my conduct would bring the matter to an end and irene adler threatens to send them the photograph and she will do it i know that she will do it you do not know her but she has a soul of steel she has the face of the most beautiful of women and the mind of the most resolute of men rather than i should marry another woman there are no lengths to which she would not go none you are sure that she has not sent it yet i am sure and why because she has said that she would send it on the day when the betrothal was publicly proclaimed that will be next monday oh then we have three days yet said holmes with a yawn that is very fortunate as i have one or two matters of importance to look into just at present your majesty will of course stay in london for the present certainly you will find me at the langham under the name of the count von kramm then i shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress pray do so i shall be all anxiety then as to money you have carte blanche absolutely i tell you that i would give one of the provinces of my kingdom to have that photograph and for present expenses the king took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak and laid it on the table there are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in notes he said holmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his note book and handed it to him and mademoiselle s address he asked is briony lodge serpentine avenue st john s wood holmes took a note of it one other question said he was the photograph a cabinet it was then good night your majesty and i trust that we shall soon have some good news for you and good night watson he added as the wheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street if you will be good enough to call to morrow afternoon at three o clock i should like to chat this little matter over with you ii at three o clock precisely i was at baker street but holmes had not yet returned the landlady informed me that he had left the house shortly after eight o clock in the morning i sat down beside the fire however with the intention of awaiting him however long he might be i was already deeply interested in his inquiry for though it was surrounded by none of the grim and strange features which were associated with the two crimes which i have already recorded still the nature of the case and the exalted station of his client gave it a character of its own indeed apart from the nature of the investigation which my friend had on hand there was something in his masterly grasp of a situation and his keen incisive reasoning which made it a pleasure to me to study his system of work and to follow the quick subtle methods by which he disentangled the most inextricable mysteries so accustomed was i to his invariable success that the very possibility of his failing had ceased to enter into my head it was close upon four before the door opened and a drunken looking groom ill kempt and side whiskered with an inflamed face and disreputable clothes walked into the room accustomed as i was to my friend s amazing powers in the use of disguises i had to look three times before i was certain that it was indeed he with a nod he vanished into the bedroom whence he emerged in five minutes tweed suited and respectable as of old putting his hands into his pockets he stretched out his legs in front of the fire and laughed heartily for some minutes well really he cried and then he choked and laughed again until he was obliged to lie back limp and helpless in the chair what is it it s quite too funny i am sure you could never guess how i employed my morning or what i ended by doing i can t imagine i suppose that you have been watching the habits and perhaps the house of miss irene adler quite so but the sequel was rather unusual i will tell you however i left the house a little after eight o clock this morning in the character of a groom out of work there is a wonderful sympathy and freemasonry among horsey men be one of them and you will know all that there is to know i soon found briony lodge it is a bijou villa with a garden at the back but built out in front right up to the road two stories chubb lock to the door large sitting room on the right side well furnished with long windows almost to the floor and those preposterous english window fasteners which a child could open behind there was nothing remarkable save that the passage window could be reached from the top of the coach house i walked round it and examined it closely from every point of view but without noting anything else of interest i then lounged down the street and found as i expected that there was a mews in a lane which runs down by one wall of the garden i lent the ostlers a hand in rubbing down their horses and received in exchange twopence a glass of half and half two fills of shag tobacco and as much information as i could desire about miss adler to say nothing of half a dozen other people in the neighbourhood in whom i was not in the least interested but whose biographies i was compelled to listen to and what of irene adler i asked oh she has turned all the men s heads down in that part she is the daintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet so say the serpentine mews to a man she lives quietly sings at concerts drives out at five every day and returns at seven sharp for dinner seldom goes out at other times except when she sings has only one male visitor but a good deal of him he is dark handsome and dashing never calls less than once a day and often twice he is a mr godfrey norton of the inner temple see the advantages of a cabman as a confidant they had driven him home a dozen times from serpentine mews and knew all about him when i had listened to all they had to tell i began to walk up and down near briony lodge once more and to think over my plan of campaign this godfrey norton was evidently an important factor in the matter he was a lawyer that sounded ominous what was the relation between them and what the object of his repeated visits was she his client his friend or his mistress if the former she had probably transferred the photograph to his keeping if the latter it was less likely on the issue of this question depended whether i should continue my work at briony lodge or turn my attention to the gentleman s chambers in the temple it was a delicate point and it widened the field of my inquiry i fear that i bore you with these details but i have to let you see my little difficulties if you are to understand the situation i am following you closely i answered i was still balancing the matter in my mind when a hansom cab drove up to briony lodge and a gentleman sprang out he was a remarkably handsome man dark aquiline and moustached evidently the man of whom i had heard he appeared to be in a great hurry shouted to the cabman to wait and brushed past the maid who opened the door with the air of a man who was thoroughly at home he was in the house about half an hour and i could catch glimpses of him in the windows of the sitting room pacing up and down talking excitedly and waving his arms of her i could see nothing presently he emerged looking even more flurried than before as he stepped up to the cab he pulled a gold watch from his pocket and looked at it earnestly drive like the devil he shouted first to gross hankey s in regent street and then to the church of st monica in the edgeware road half a guinea if you do it in twenty minutes away they went and i was just wondering whether i should not do well to follow them when up the lane came a neat little landau the coachman with his coat only half buttoned and his tie under his ear while all the tags of his harness were sticking out of the buckles it hadn t pulled up before she shot out of the hall door and into it i only caught a glimpse of her at the moment but she was a lovely woman with a face that a man might die for the church of st monica john she cried and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes this was quite too good to lose watson i was just balancing whether i should run for it or whether i should perch behind her landau when a cab came through the street the driver looked twice at such a shabby fare but i jumped in before he could object the church of st monica said i and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes it was twenty five minutes to twelve and of course it was clear enough what was in the wind my cabby drove fast i don t think i ever drove faster but the others were there before us the cab and the landau with their steaming horses were in front of the door when i arrived i paid the man and hurried into the church there was not a soul there save the two whom i had followed and a surpliced clergyman who seemed to be expostulating with them they were all three standing in a knot in front of the altar i lounged up the side aisle like any other idler who has dropped into a church suddenly to my surprise the three at the altar faced round to me and godfrey norton came running as hard as he could towards me thank god he cried you ll do come come what then i asked come man come only three minutes or it won t be legal i was half dragged up to the altar and before i knew where i was i found myself mumbling responses which were whispered in my ear and vouching for things of which i knew nothing and generally assisting in the secure tying up of irene adler spinster to godfrey norton bachelor it was all done in an instant and there was the gentleman thanking me on the one side and the lady on the other while the clergyman beamed on me in front it was the most preposterous position in which i ever found myself in my life and it was the thought of it that started me laughing just now it seems that there had been some informality about their license that the clergyman absolutely refused to marry them without a witness of some sort and that my lucky appearance saved the bridegroom from having to sally out into the streets in search of a best man the bride gave me a sovereign and i mean to wear it on my watch chain in memory of the occasion this is a very unexpected turn of affairs said i and what then well i found my plans very seriously menaced it looked as if the pair might take an immediate departure and so necessitate very prompt and energetic measures on my part at the church door however they separated he driving back to the temple and she to her own house i shall drive out in the park at five as usual she said as she left him i heard no more they drove away in different directions and i went off to make my own arrangements which are some cold beef and a glass of beer he answered ringing the bell i have been too busy to think of food and i am likely to be busier still this evening by the way doctor i shall want your co operation i shall be delighted you don t mind breaking the law not in the least nor running a chance of arrest not in a good cause oh the cause is excellent then i am your man i was sure that i might rely on you but what is it you wish when mrs turner has brought in the tray i will make it clear to you now he said as he turned hungrily on the simple fare that our landlady had provided i must discuss it while i eat for i have not much time it is nearly five now in two hours we must be on the scene of action miss irene or madame rather returns from her drive at seven we must be at briony lodge to meet her and what then you must leave that to me i have already arranged what is to occur there is only one point on which i must insist you must not interfere come what may you understand i am to be neutral to do nothing whatever there will probably be some small unpleasantness do not join in it it will end in my being conveyed into the house four or five minutes afterwards the sitting room window will open you are to station yourself close to that open window yes you are to watch me for i will be visible to you yes and when i raise my hand so you will throw into the room what i give you to throw and will at the same time raise the cry of fire you quite follow me entirely it is nothing very formidable he said taking a long cigar shaped roll from his pocket it is an ordinary plumber s smoke rocket fitted with a cap at either end to make it self lighting your task is confined to that when you raise your cry of fire it will be taken up by quite a number of people you may then walk to the end of the street and i will rejoin you in ten minutes i hope that i have made myself clear i am to remain neutral to get near the window to watch you and at the signal to throw in this object then to raise the cry of fire and to wait you at the corner of the street precisely then you may entirely rely on me that is excellent i think perhaps it is almost time that i prepare for the new role i have to play he disappeared into his bedroom and returned in a few minutes in the character of an amiable and simple minded nonconformist clergyman his broad black hat his baggy trousers his white tie his sympathetic smile and general look of peering and benevolent curiosity were such as mr john hare alone could have equalled it was not merely that holmes changed his costume his expression his manner his very soul seemed to vary with every fresh part that he assumed the stage lost a fine actor even as science lost an acute reasoner when he became a specialist in crime it was a quarter past six when we left baker street and it still wanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves in serpentine avenue it was already dusk and the lamps were just being lighted as we paced up and down in front of briony lodge waiting for the coming of its occupant the house was just such as i had pictured it from sherlock holmes succinct description but the locality appeared to be less private than i expected on the contrary for a small street in a quiet neighbourhood it was remarkably animated there was a group of shabbily dressed men smoking and laughing in a corner a scissors grinder with his wheel two guardsmen who were flirting with a nurse girl and several well dressed young men who were lounging up and down with cigars in their mouths you see remarked holmes as we paced to and fro in front of the house this marriage rather simplifies matters the photograph becomes a double edged weapon now the chances are that she would be as averse to its being seen by mr godfrey norton as our client is to its coming to the eyes of his princess now the question is where are we to find the photograph where indeed it is most unlikely that she carries it about with her it is cabinet size too large for easy concealment about a woman s dress she knows that the king is capable of having her waylaid and searched two attempts of the sort have already been made we may take it then that she does not carry it about with her where then her banker or her lawyer there is that double possibility but i am inclined to think neither women are naturally secretive and they like to do their own secreting why should she hand it over to anyone else she could trust her own guardianship but she could not tell what indirect or political influence might be brought to bear upon a business man besides remember that she had resolved to use it within a few days it must be where she can lay her hands upon it it must be in her own house but it has twice been burgled pshaw they did not know how to look but how will you look i will not look what then i will get her to show me but she will refuse she will not be able to but i hear the rumble of wheels it is her carriage now carry out my orders to the letter as he spoke the gleam of the sidelights of a carriage came round the curve of the avenue it was a smart little landau which rattled up to the door of briony lodge as it pulled up one of the loafing men at the corner dashed forward to open the door in the hope of earning a copper but was elbowed away by another loafer who had rushed up with the same intention a fierce quarrel broke out which was increased by the two guardsmen who took sides with one of the loungers and by the scissors grinder who was equally hot upon the other side a blow was struck and in an instant the lady who had stepped from her carriage was the centre of a little knot of flushed and struggling men who struck savagely at each other with their fists and sticks holmes dashed into the crowd to protect the lady but just as he reached her he gave a cry and dropped to the ground with the blood running freely down his face at his fall the guardsmen took to their heels in one direction and the loungers in the other while a number of better dressed people who had watched the scuffle without taking part in it crowded in to help the lady and to attend to the injured man irene adler as i will still call her had hurried up the steps but she stood at the top with her superb figure outlined against the lights of the hall looking back into the street is the poor gentleman much hurt she asked he is dead cried several voices no no there s life in him shouted another but he ll be gone before you can get him to hospital he s a brave fellow said a woman they would have had the lady s purse and watch if it hadn t been for him they were a gang and a rough one too ah he s breathing now he can t lie in the street may we bring him in marm surely bring him into the sitting room there is a comfortable sofa this way please slowly and solemnly he was borne into briony lodge and laid out in the principal room while i still observed the proceedings from my post by the window the lamps had been lit but the blinds had not been drawn so that i could see holmes as he lay upon the couch i do not know whether he was seized with compunction at that moment for the part he was playing but i know that i never felt more heartily ashamed of myself in my life than when i saw the beautiful creature against whom i was conspiring or the grace and kindliness with which she waited upon the injured man and yet it would be the blackest treachery to holmes to draw back now from the part which he had intrusted to me i hardened my heart and took the smoke rocket from under my ulster after all i thought we are not injuring her we are but preventing her from injuring another holmes had sat up upon the couch and i saw him motion like a man who is in need of air a maid rushed across and threw open the window at the same instant i saw him raise his hand and at the signal i tossed my rocket into the room with a cry of fire the word was no sooner out of my mouth than the whole crowd of spectators well dressed and ill gentlemen ostlers and servant maids joined in a general shriek of fire thick clouds of smoke curled through the room and out at the open window i caught a glimpse of rushing figures and a moment later the voice of holmes from within assuring them that it was a false alarm slipping through the shouting crowd i made my way to the corner of the street and in ten minutes was rejoiced to find my friend s arm in mine and to get away from the scene of uproar he walked swiftly and in silence for some few minutes until we had turned down one of the quiet streets which lead towards the edgeware road you did it very nicely doctor he remarked nothing could have been better it is all right you have the photograph i know where it is and how did you find out she showed me as i told you she would i am still in the dark i do not wish to make a mystery said he laughing the matter was perfectly simple you of course saw that everyone in the street was an accomplice they were all engaged for the evening i guessed as much then when the row broke out i had a little moist red paint in the palm of my hand i rushed forward fell down clapped my hand to my face and became a piteous spectacle it is an old trick that also i could fathom then they carried me in she was bound to have me in what else could she do and into her sitting room which was the very room which i suspected it lay between that and her bedroom and i was determined to see which they laid me on a couch i motioned for air they were compelled to open the window and you had your chance how did that help you it was all important when a woman thinks that her house is on fire her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she values most it is a perfectly overpowering impulse and i have more than once taken advantage of it in the case of the darlington substitution scandal it was of use to me and also in the arnsworth castle business a married woman grabs at her baby an unmarried one reaches for her jewel box now it was clear to me that our lady of to day had nothing in the house more precious to her than what we are in quest of she would rush to secure it the alarm of fire was admirably done the smoke and shouting were enough to shake nerves of steel she responded beautifully the photograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the right bell pull she was there in an instant and i caught a glimpse of it as she half drew it out when i cried out that it was a false alarm she replaced it glanced at the rocket rushed from the room and i have not seen her since i rose and making my excuses escaped from the house i hesitated whether to attempt to secure the photograph at once but the coachman had come in and as he was watching me narrowly it seemed safer to wait a little over precipitance may ruin all and now i asked our quest is practically finished i shall call with the king to morrow and with you if you care to come with us we will be shown into the sitting room to wait for the lady but it is probable that when she comes she may find neither us nor the photograph it might be a satisfaction to his majesty to regain it with his own hands and when will you call at eight in the morning she will not be up so that we shall have a clear field besides we must be prompt for this marriage may mean a complete change in her life and habits i must wire to the king without delay we had reached baker street and had stopped at the door he was searching his pockets for the key when someone passing said good night mister sherlock holmes there were several people on the pavement at the time but the greeting appeared to come from a slim youth in an ulster who had hurried by i ve heard that voice before said holmes staring down the dimly lit street now i wonder who the deuce that could have been iii i slept at baker street that night and we were engaged upon our toast and coffee in the morning when the king of bohemia rushed into the room you have really got it he cried grasping sherlock holmes by either shoulder and looking eagerly into his face not yet but you have hopes i have hopes then come i am all impatience to be gone we must have a cab no my brougham is waiting then that will simplify matters we descended and started off once more for briony lodge irene adler is married remarked holmes married when yesterday but to whom to an english lawyer named norton but she could not love him i am in hopes that she does and why in hopes because it would spare your majesty all fear of future annoyance if the lady loves her husband she does not love your majesty if she does not love your majesty there is no reason why she should interfere with your majesty s plan it is true and yet well i wish she had been of my own station what a queen she would have made he relapsed into a moody silence which was not broken until we drew up in serpentine avenue the door of briony lodge was open and an elderly woman stood upon the steps she watched us with a sardonic eye as we stepped from the brougham mr sherlock holmes i believe said she i am mr holmes answered my companion looking at her with a questioning and rather startled gaze indeed my mistress told me that you were likely to call she left this morning with her husband by the train from charing cross for the continent what sherlock holmes staggered back white with chagrin and surprise do you mean that she has left england never to return and the papers asked the king hoarsely all is lost we shall see he pushed past the servant and rushed into the drawing room followed by the king and myself the furniture was scattered about in every direction with dismantled shelves and open drawers as if the lady had hurriedly ransacked them before her flight holmes rushed at the bell pull tore back a small sliding shutter and plunging in his hand pulled out a photograph and a letter the photograph was of irene adler herself in evening dress the letter was superscribed to sherlock holmes esq to be left till called for my friend tore it open and we all three read it together it was dated at midnight of the preceding night and ran in this way my dear mr sherlock holmes you really did it very well you took me in completely until after the alarm of fire i had not a suspicion but then when i found how i had betrayed myself i began to think i had been warned against you months ago i had been told that if the king employed an agent it would certainly be you and your address had been given me yet with all this you made me reveal what you wanted to know even after i became suspicious i found it hard to think evil of such a dear kind old clergyman but you know i have been trained as an actress myself male costume is nothing new to me i often take advantage of the freedom which it gives i sent john the coachman to watch you ran upstairs got into my walking clothes as i call them and came down just as you departed well i followed you to your door and so made sure that i was really an object of interest to the celebrated mr sherlock holmes then i rather imprudently wished you good night and started for the temple to see my husband we both thought the best resource was flight when pursued by so formidable an antagonist so you will find the nest empty when you call to morrow as to the photograph your client may rest in peace i love and am loved by a better man than he the king may do what he will without hindrance from one whom he has cruelly wronged i keep it only to safeguard myself and to preserve a weapon which will always secure me from any steps which he might take in the future i leave a photograph which he might care to possess and i remain dear mr sherlock holmes very truly yours irene norton n e adler what a woman oh what a woman cried the king of bohemia when we had all three read this epistle did i not tell you how quick and resolute she was would she not have made an admirable queen is it not a pity that she was not on my level from what i have seen of the lady she seems indeed to be on a very different level to your majesty said holmes coldly i am sorry that i have not been able to bring your majesty s business to a more successful conclusion on the contrary my dear sir cried the king nothing could be more successful i know that her word is inviolate the photograph is now as safe as if it were in the fire i am glad to hear your majesty say so i am immensely indebted to you pray tell me in what way i can reward you this ring he slipped an emerald snake ring from his finger and held it out upon the palm of his hand your majesty has something which i should value even more highly said holmes you have but to name it this photograph the king stared at him in amazement irene s photograph he cried certainly if you wish it i thank your majesty then there is no more to be done in the matter i have the honour to wish you a very good morning he bowed and turning away without observing the hand which the king had stretched out to him he set off in my company for his chambers and that was how a great scandal threatened to affect the kingdom of bohemia and how the best plans of mr sherlock holmes were beaten by a woman s wit he used to make merry over the cleverness of women but i have not heard him do it of late and when he speaks of irene adler or when he refers to her photograph it is always under the honourable title of the woman ii the red headed league i had called upon my friend mr sherlock holmes one day in the autumn of last year and found him in deep conversation with a very stout florid faced elderly gentleman with fiery red hair with an apology for my intrusion i was about to withdraw when holmes pulled me abruptly into the room and closed the door behind me you could not possibly have come at a better time my dear watson he said cordially i was afraid that you were engaged so i am very much so then i can wait in the next room not at all this gentleman mr wilson has been my partner and helper in many of my most successful cases and i have no doubt that he will be of the utmost use to me in yours also the stout gentleman half rose from his chair and gave a bob of greeting with a quick little questioning glance from his small fat encircled eyes try the settee said holmes relapsing into his armchair and putting his fingertips together as was his custom when in judicial moods i know my dear watson that you share my love of all that is bizarre and outside the conventions and humdrum routine of everyday life you have shown your relish for it by the enthusiasm which has prompted you to chronicle and if you will excuse my saying so somewhat to embellish so many of my own little adventures your cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me i observed you will remember that i remarked the other day just before we went into the very simple problem presented by miss mary sutherland that for strange effects and extraordinary combinations we must go to life itself which is always far more daring than any effort of the imagination a proposition which i took the liberty of doubting you did doctor but none the less you must come round to my view for otherwise i shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you until your reason breaks down under them and acknowledges me to be right now mr jabez wilson here has been good enough to call upon me this morning and to begin a narrative which promises to be one of the most singular which i have listened to for some time you have heard me remark that the strangest and most unique things are very often connected not with the larger but with the smaller crimes and occasionally indeed where there is room for doubt whether any positive crime has been committed as far as i have heard it is impossible for me to say whether the present case is an instance of crime or not but the course of events is certainly among the most singular that i have ever listened to perhaps mr wilson you would have the great kindness to recommence your narrative i ask you not merely because my friend dr watson has not heard the opening part but also because the peculiar nature of the story makes me anxious to have every possible detail from your lips as a rule when i have heard some slight indication of the course of events i am able to guide myself by the thousands of other similar cases which occur to my memory in the present instance i am forced to admit that the facts are to the best of my belief unique the portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of some little pride and pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the inside pocket of his greatcoat as he glanced down the advertisement column with his head thrust forward and the paper flattened out upon his knee i took a good look at the man and endeavoured after the fashion of my companion to read the indications which might be presented by his dress or appearance i did not gain very much however by my inspection our visitor bore every mark of being an average commonplace british tradesman obese pompous and slow he wore rather baggy grey shepherd s check trousers a not over clean black frock coat unbuttoned in the front and a drab waistcoat with a heavy brassy albert chain and a square pierced bit of metal dangling down as an ornament a frayed top hat and a faded brown overcoat with a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him altogether look as i would there was nothing remarkable about the man save his blazing red head and the expression of extreme chagrin and discontent upon his features sherlock holmes quick eye took in my occupation and he shook his head with a smile as he noticed my questioning glances beyond the obvious facts that he has at some time done manual labour that he takes snuff that he is a freemason that he has been in china and that he has done a considerable amount of writing lately i can deduce nothing else mr jabez wilson started up in his chair with his forefinger upon the paper but his eyes upon my companion how in the name of good fortune did you know all that mr holmes he asked how did you know for example that i did manual labour it s as true as gospel for i began as a ship s carpenter your hands my dear sir your right hand is quite a size larger than your left you have worked with it and the muscles are more developed well the snuff then and the freemasonry i won t insult your intelligence by telling you how i read that especially as rather against the strict rules of your order you use an arc and compass breastpin ah of course i forgot that but the writing what else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny for five inches and the left one with the smooth patch near the elbow where you rest it upon the desk well but china the fish that you have tattooed immediately above your right wrist could only have been done in china i have made a small study of tattoo marks and have even contributed to the literature of the subject that trick of staining the fishes scales of a delicate pink is quite peculiar to china when in addition i see a chinese coin hanging from your watch chain the matter becomes even more simple mr jabez wilson laughed heavily well i never said he i thought at first that you had done something clever but i see that there was nothing in it after all i begin to think watson said holmes that i make a mistake in explaining omne ignotum pro magnifico you know and my poor little reputation such as it is will suffer shipwreck if i am so candid can you not find the advertisement mr wilson yes i have got it now he answered with his thick red finger planted halfway down the column here it is this is what began it all you just read it for yourself sir i took the paper from him and read as follows to the red headed league on account of the bequest of the late ezekiah hopkins of lebanon pennsylvania u s a there is now another vacancy open which entitles a member of the league to a salary of a week for purely nominal services all red headed men who are sound in body and mind and above the age of twenty one years are eligible apply in person on monday at eleven o clock to duncan ross at the offices of the league pope s court fleet street what on earth does this mean i ejaculated after i had twice read over the extraordinary announcement holmes chuckled and wriggled in his chair as was his habit when in high spirits it is a little off the beaten track isn t it said he and now mr wilson off you go at scratch and tell us all about yourself your household and the effect which this advertisement had upon your fortunes you will first make a note doctor of the paper and the date it is the morning chronicle of april just two months ago very good now mr wilson well it is just as i have been telling you mr sherlock holmes said jabez wilson mopping his forehead i have a small pawnbroker s business at coburg square near the city it s not a very large affair and of late years it has not done more than just give me a living i used to be able to keep two assistants but now i only keep one and i would have a job to pay him but that he is willing to come for half wages so as to learn the business what is the name of this obliging youth asked sherlock holmes his name is vincent spaulding and he s not such a youth either it s hard to say his age i should not wish a smarter assistant mr holmes and i know very well that he could better himself and earn twice what i am able to give him but after all if he is satisfied why should i put ideas in his head why indeed you seem most fortunate in having an employ who comes under the full market price it is not a common experience among employers in this age i don t know that your assistant is not as remarkable as your advertisement oh he has his faults too said mr wilson never was such a fellow for photography snapping away with a camera when he ought to be improving his mind and then diving down into the cellar like a rabbit into its hole to develop his pictures that is his main fault but on the whole he s a good worker there s no vice in him he is still with you i presume yes sir he and a girl of fourteen who does a bit of simple cooking and keeps the place clean that s all i have in the house for i am a widower and never had any family we live very quietly sir the three of us and we keep a roof over our heads and pay our debts if we do nothing more the first thing that put us out was that advertisement spaulding he came down into the office just this day eight weeks with this very paper in his hand and he says i wish to the lord mr wilson that i was a red headed man why that i asks why says he here s another vacancy on the league of the red headed men it s worth quite a little fortune to any man who gets it and i understand that there are more vacancies than there are men so that the trustees are at their wits end what to do with the money if my hair would only change colour here s a nice little crib all ready for me to step into why what is it then i asked you see mr holmes i am a very stay at home man and as my business came to me instead of my having to go to it i was often weeks on end without putting my foot over the door mat in that way i didn t know much of what was going on outside and i was always glad of a bit of news have you never heard of the league of the red headed men he asked with his eyes open never why i wonder at that for you are eligible yourself for one of the vacancies and what are they worth i asked oh merely a couple of hundred a year but the work is slight and it need not interfere very much with one s other occupations well you can easily think that that made me prick up my ears for the business has not been over good for some years and an extra couple of hundred would have been very handy tell me all about it said i well said he showing me the advertisement you can see for yourself that the league has a vacancy and there is the address where you should apply for particulars as far as i can make out the league was founded by an american millionaire ezekiah hopkins who was very peculiar in his ways he was himself red headed and he had a great sympathy for all red headed men so when he died it was found that he had left his enormous fortune in the hands of trustees with instructions to apply the interest to the providing of easy berths to men whose hair is of that colour from all i hear it is splendid pay and very little to do but said i there would be millions of red headed men who would apply not so many as you might think he answered you see it is really confined to londoners and to grown men this american had started from london when he was young and he wanted to do the old town a good turn then again i have heard it is no use your applying if your hair is light red or dark red or anything but real bright blazing fiery red now if you cared to apply mr wilson you would just walk in but perhaps it would hardly be worth your while to put yourself out of the way for the sake of a few hundred pounds now it is a fact gentlemen as you may see for yourselves that my hair is of a very full and rich tint so that it seemed to me that if there was to be any competition in the matter i stood as good a chance as any man that i had ever met vincent spaulding seemed to know so much about it that i thought he might prove useful so i just ordered him to put up the shutters for the day and to come right away with me he was very willing to have a holiday so we shut the business up and started off for the address that was given us in the advertisement i never hope to see such a sight as that again mr holmes from north south east and west every man who had a shade of red in his hair had tramped into the city to answer the advertisement fleet street was choked with red headed folk and pope s court looked like a coster s orange barrow i should not have thought there were so many in the whole country as were brought together by that single advertisement every shade of colour they were straw lemon orange brick irish setter liver clay but as spaulding said there were not many who had the real vivid flame coloured tint when i saw how many were waiting i would have given it up in despair but spaulding would not hear of it how he did it i could not imagine but he pushed and pulled and butted until he got me through the crowd and right up to the steps which led to the office there was a double stream upon the stair some going up in hope and some coming back dejected but we wedged in as well as we could and soon found ourselves in the office your experience has been a most entertaining one remarked holmes as his client paused and refreshed his memory with a huge pinch of snuff pray continue your very interesting statement there was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden chairs and a deal table behind which sat a small man with a head that was even redder than mine he said a few words to each candidate as he came up and then he always managed to find some fault in them which would disqualify them getting a vacancy did not seem to be such a very easy matter after all however when our turn came the little man was much more favourable to me than to any of the others and he closed the door as we entered so that he might have a private word with us this is mr jabez wilson said my assistant and he is willing to fill a vacancy in the league and he is admirably suited for it the other answered he has every requirement i cannot recall when i have seen anything so fine he took a step backward cocked his head on one side and gazed at my hair until i felt quite bashful then suddenly he plunged forward wrung my hand and congratulated me warmly on my success it would be injustice to hesitate said he you will however i am sure excuse me for taking an obvious precaution with that he seized my hair in both his hands and tugged until i yelled with the pain there is water in your eyes said he as he released me i perceive that all is as it should be but we have to be careful for we have twice been deceived by wigs and once by paint i could tell you tales of cobbler s wax which would disgust you with human nature he stepped over to the window and shouted through it at the top of his voice that the vacancy was filled a groan of disappointment came up from below and the folk all trooped away in different directions until there was not a red head to be seen except my own and that of the manager my name said he is mr duncan ross and i am myself one of the pensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor are you a married man mr wilson have you a family i answered that i had not his face fell immediately dear me he said gravely that is very serious indeed i am sorry to hear you say that the fund was of course for the propagation and spread of the red heads as well as for their maintenance it is exceedingly unfortunate that you should be a bachelor my face lengthened at this mr holmes for i thought that i was not to have the vacancy after all but after thinking it over for a few minutes he said that it would be all right in the case of another said he the objection might be fatal but we must stretch a point in favour of a man with such a head of hair as yours when shall you be able to enter upon your new duties well it is a little awkward for i have a business already said i oh never mind about that mr wilson said vincent spaulding i should be able to look after that for you what would be the hours i asked ten to two now a pawnbroker s business is mostly done of an evening mr holmes especially thursday and friday evening which is just before pay day so it would suit me very well to earn a little in the mornings besides i knew that my assistant was a good man and that he would see to anything that turned up that would suit me very well said i and the pay is a week and the work is purely nominal what do you call purely nominal well you have to be in the office or at least in the building the whole time if you leave you forfeit your whole position forever the will is very clear upon that point you don t comply with the conditions if you budge from the office during that time it s only four hours a day and i should not think of leaving said i no excuse will avail said mr duncan ross neither sickness nor business nor anything else there you must stay or you lose your billet and the work is to copy out the encyclop dia britannica there is the first volume of it in that press you must find your own ink pens and blotting paper but we provide this table and chair will you be ready to morrow certainly i answered then good bye mr jabez wilson and let me congratulate you once more on the important position which you have been fortunate enough to gain he bowed me out of the room and i went home with my assistant hardly knowing what to say or do i was so pleased at my own good fortune well i thought over the matter all day and by evening i was in low spirits again for i had quite persuaded myself that the whole affair must be some great hoax or fraud though what its object might be i could not imagine it seemed altogether past belief that anyone could make such a will or that they would pay such a sum for doing anything so simple as copying out the encyclop dia britannica vincent spaulding did what he could to cheer me up but by bedtime i had reasoned myself out of the whole thing however in the morning i determined to have a look at it anyhow so i bought a penny bottle of ink and with a quill pen and seven sheets of foolscap paper i started off for pope s court well to my surprise and delight everything was as right as possible the table was set out ready for me and mr duncan ross was there to see that i got fairly to work he started me off upon the letter a and then he left me but he would drop in from time to time to see that all was right with me at two o clock he bade me good day complimented me upon the amount that i had written and locked the door of the office after me this went on day after day mr holmes and on saturday the manager came in and planked down four golden sovereigns for my week s work it was the same next week and the same the week after every morning i was there at ten and every afternoon i left at two by degrees mr duncan ross took to coming in only once of a morning and then after a time he did not come in at all still of course i never dared to leave the room for an instant for i was not sure when he might come and the billet was such a good one and suited me so well that i would not risk the loss of it eight weeks passed away like this and i had written about abbots and archery and armour and architecture and attica and hoped with diligence that i might get on to the b s before very long it cost me something in foolscap and i had pretty nearly filled a shelf with my writings and then suddenly the whole business came to an end to an end yes sir and no later than this morning i went to my work as usual at ten o clock but the door was shut and locked with a little square of cardboard hammered on to the middle of the panel with a tack here it is and you can read for yourself he held up a piece of white cardboard about the size of a sheet of note paper it read in this fashion the red headed league is dissolved october sherlock holmes and i surveyed this curt announcement and the rueful face behind it until the comical side of the affair so completely overtopped every other consideration that we both burst out into a roar of laughter i cannot see that there is anything very funny cried our client flushing up to the roots of his flaming head if you can do nothing better than laugh at me i can go elsewhere no no cried holmes shoving him back into the chair from which he had half risen i really wouldn t miss your case for the world it is most refreshingly unusual but there is if you will excuse my saying so something just a little funny about it pray what steps did you take when you found the card upon the door i was staggered sir i did not know what to do then i called at the offices round but none of them seemed to know anything about it finally i went to the landlord who is an accountant living on the ground floor and i asked him if he could tell me what had become of the red headed league he said that he had never heard of any such body then i asked him who mr duncan ross was he answered that the name was new to him well said i the gentleman at no what the red headed man yes oh said he his name was william morris he was a solicitor and was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new premises were ready he moved out yesterday where could i find him oh at his new offices he did tell me the address yes king edward street near st paul s i started off mr holmes but when i got to that address it was a manufactory of artificial knee caps and no one in it had ever heard of either mr william morris or mr duncan ross and what did you do then asked holmes i went home to saxe coburg square and i took the advice of my assistant but he could not help me in any way he could only say that if i waited i should hear by post but that was not quite good enough mr holmes i did not wish to lose such a place without a struggle so as i had heard that you were good enough to give advice to poor folk who were in need of it i came right away to you and you did very wisely said holmes your case is an exceedingly remarkable one and i shall be happy to look into it from what you have told me i think that it is possible that graver issues hang from it than might at first sight appear grave enough said mr jabez wilson why i have lost four pound a week as far as you are personally concerned remarked holmes i do not see that you have any grievance against this extraordinary league on the contrary you are as i understand richer by some to say nothing of the minute knowledge which you have gained on every subject which comes under the letter a you have lost nothing by them no sir but i want to find out about them and who they are and what their object was in playing this prank if it was a prank upon me it was a pretty expensive joke for them for it cost them two and thirty pounds we shall endeavour to clear up these points for you and first one or two questions mr wilson this assistant of yours who first called your attention to the advertisement how long had he been with you about a month then how did he come in answer to an advertisement was he the only applicant no i had a dozen why did you pick him because he was handy and would come cheap at half wages in fact yes what is he like this vincent spaulding small stout built very quick in his ways no hair on his face though he s not short of thirty has a white splash of acid upon his forehead holmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement i thought as much said he have you ever observed that his ears are pierced for earrings yes sir he told me that a gipsy had done it for him when he was a lad hum said holmes sinking back in deep thought he is still with you oh yes sir i have only just left him and has your business been attended to in your absence nothing to complain of sir there s never very much to do of a morning that will do mr wilson i shall be happy to give you an opinion upon the subject in the course of a day or two to day is saturday and i hope that by monday we may come to a conclusion well watson said holmes when our visitor had left us what do you make of it all i make nothing of it i answered frankly it is a most mysterious business as a rule said holmes the more bizarre a thing is the less mysterious it proves to be it is your commonplace featureless crimes which are really puzzling just as a commonplace face is the most difficult to identify but i must be prompt over this matter what are you going to do then i asked to smoke he answered it is quite a three pipe problem and i beg that you won t speak to me for fifty minutes he curled himself up in his chair with his thin knees drawn up to his hawk like nose and there he sat with his eyes closed and his black clay pipe thrusting out like the bill of some strange bird i had come to the conclusion that he had dropped asleep and indeed was nodding myself when he suddenly sprang out of his chair with the gesture of a man who has made up his mind and put his pipe down upon the mantelpiece sarasate plays at the st james s hall this afternoon he remarked what do you think watson could your patients spare you for a few hours i have nothing to do to day my practice is never very absorbing then put on your hat and come i am going through the city first and we can have some lunch on the way i observe that there is a good deal of german music on the programme which is rather more to my taste than italian or french it is introspective and i want to introspect come along we travelled by the underground as far as aldersgate and a short walk took us to saxe coburg square the scene of the singular story which we had listened to in the morning it was a poky little shabby genteel place where four lines of dingy two storied brick houses looked out into a small railed in enclosure where a lawn of weedy grass and a few clumps of faded laurel bushes made a hard fight against a smoke laden and uncongenial atmosphere three gilt balls and a brown board with jabez wilson in white letters upon a corner house announced the place where our red headed client carried on his business sherlock holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side and looked it all over with his eyes shining brightly between puckered lids then he walked slowly up the street and then down again to the corner still looking keenly at the houses finally he returned to the pawnbroker s and having thumped vigorously upon the pavement with his stick two or three times he went up to the door and knocked it was instantly opened by a bright looking clean shaven young fellow who asked him to step in thank you said holmes i only wished to ask you how you would go from here to the strand third right fourth left answered the assistant promptly closing the door smart fellow that observed holmes as we walked away he is in my judgment the fourth smartest man in london and for daring i am not sure that he has not a claim to be third i have known something of him before evidently said i mr wilson s assistant counts for a good deal in this mystery of the red headed league i am sure that you inquired your way merely in order that you might see him not him what then the knees of his trousers and what did you see what i expected to see why did you beat the pavement my dear doctor this is a time for observation not for talk we are spies in an enemy s country we know something of saxe coburg square let us now explore the parts which lie behind it the road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the corner from the retired saxe coburg square presented as great a contrast to it as the front of a picture does to the back it was one of the main arteries which conveyed the traffic of the city to the north and west the roadway was blocked with the immense stream of commerce flowing in a double tide inward and outward while the footpaths were black with the hurrying swarm of pedestrians it was difficult to realise as we looked at the line of fine shops and stately business premises that they really abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant square which we had just quitted let me see said holmes standing at the corner and glancing along the line i should like just to remember the order of the houses here it is a hobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of london there is mortimer s the tobacconist the little newspaper shop the coburg branch of the city and suburban bank the vegetarian restaurant and mcfarlane s carriage building depot that carries us right on to the other block and now doctor we ve done our work so it s time we had some play a sandwich and a cup of coffee and then off to violin land where all is sweetness and delicacy and harmony and there are no red headed clients to vex us with their conundrums my friend was an enthusiastic musician being himself not only a very capable performer but a composer of no ordinary merit all the afternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect happiness gently waving his long thin fingers in time to the music while his gently smiling face and his languid dreamy eyes were as unlike those of holmes the sleuth hound holmes the relentless keen witted ready handed criminal agent as it was possible to conceive in his singular character the dual nature alternately asserted itself and his extreme exactness and astuteness represented as i have often thought the reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood which occasionally predominated in him the swing of his nature took him from extreme languor to devouring energy and as i knew well he was never so truly formidable as when for days on end he had been lounging in his armchair amid his improvisations and his black letter editions then it was that the lust of the chase would suddenly come upon him and that his brilliant reasoning power would rise to the level of intuition until those who were unacquainted with his methods would look askance at him as on a man whose knowledge was not that of other mortals when i saw him that afternoon so enwrapped in the music at st james s hall i felt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom he had set himself to hunt down you want to go home no doubt doctor he remarked as we emerged yes it would be as well and i have some business to do which will take some hours this business at coburg square is serious why serious a considerable crime is in contemplation i have every reason to believe that we shall be in time to stop it but to day being saturday rather complicates matters i shall want your help to night at what time ten will be early enough i shall be at baker street at ten very well and i say doctor there may be some little danger so kindly put your army revolver in your pocket he waved his hand turned on his heel and disappeared in an instant among the crowd i trust that i am not more dense than my neighbours but i was always oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with sherlock holmes here i had heard what he had heard i had seen what he had seen and yet from his words it was evident that he saw clearly not only what had happened but what was about to happen while to me the whole business was still confused and grotesque as i drove home to my house in kensington i thought over it all from the extraordinary story of the red headed copier of the encyclop dia down to the visit to saxe coburg square and the ominous words with which he had parted from me what was this nocturnal expedition and why should i go armed where were we going and what were we to do i had the hint from holmes that this smooth faced pawnbroker s assistant was a formidable man a man who might play a deep game i tried to puzzle it out but gave it up in despair and set the matter aside until night should bring an explanation it was a quarter past nine when i started from home and made my way across the park and so through oxford street to baker street two hansoms were standing at the door and as i entered the passage i heard the sound of voices from above on entering his room i found holmes in animated conversation with two men one of whom i recognised as peter jones the official police agent while the other was a long thin sad faced man with a very shiny hat and oppressively respectable frock coat ha our party is complete said holmes buttoning up his pea jacket and taking his heavy hunting crop from the rack watson i think you know mr jones of scotland yard let me introduce you to mr merryweather who is to be our companion in to night s adventure we re hunting in couples again doctor you see said jones in his consequential way our friend here is a wonderful man for starting a chase all he wants is an old dog to help him to do the running down i hope a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase observed mr merryweather gloomily you may place considerable confidence in mr holmes sir said the police agent loftily he has his own little methods which are if he won t mind my saying so just a little too theoretical and fantastic but he has the makings of a detective in him it is not too much to say that once or twice as in that business of the sholto murder and the agra treasure he has been more nearly correct than the official force oh if you say so mr jones it is all right said the stranger with deference still i confess that i miss my rubber it is the first saturday night for seven and twenty years that i have not had my rubber i think you will find said sherlock holmes that you will play for a higher stake to night than you have ever done yet and that the play will be more exciting for you mr merryweather the stake will be some and for you jones it will be the man upon whom you wish to lay your hands john clay the murderer thief smasher and forger he s a young man mr merryweather but he is at the head of his profession and i would rather have my bracelets on him than on any criminal in london he s a remarkable man is young john clay his grandfather was a royal duke and he himself has been to eton and oxford his brain is as cunning as his fingers and though we meet signs of him at every turn we never know where to find the man himself he ll crack a crib in scotland one week and be raising money to build an orphanage in cornwall the next i ve been on his track for years and have never set eyes on him yet i hope that i may have the pleasure of introducing you to night i ve had one or two little turns also with mr john clay and i agree with you that he is at the head of his profession it is past ten however and quite time that we started if you two will take the first hansom watson and i will follow in the second sherlock holmes was not very communicative during the long drive and lay back in the cab humming the tunes which he had heard in the afternoon we rattled through an endless labyrinth of gas lit streets until we emerged into farrington street we are close there now my friend remarked this fellow merryweather is a bank director and personally interested in the matter i thought it as well to have jones with us also he is not a bad fellow though an absolute imbecile in his profession he has one positive virtue he is as brave as a bulldog and as tenacious as a lobster if he gets his claws upon anyone here we are and they are waiting for us we had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had found ourselves in the morning our cabs were dismissed and following the guidance of mr merryweather we passed down a narrow passage and through a side door which he opened for us within there was a small corridor which ended in a very massive iron gate this also was opened and led down a flight of winding stone steps which terminated at another formidable gate mr merryweather stopped to light a lantern and then conducted us down a dark earth smelling passage and so after opening a third door into a huge vault or cellar which was piled all round with crates and massive boxes you are not very vulnerable from above holmes remarked as he held up the lantern and gazed about him nor from below said mr merryweather striking his stick upon the flags which lined the floor why dear me it sounds quite hollow he remarked looking up in surprise i must really ask you to be a little more quiet said holmes severely you have already imperilled the whole success of our expedition might i beg that you would have the goodness to sit down upon one of those boxes and not to interfere the solemn mr merryweather perched himself upon a crate with a very injured expression upon his face while holmes fell upon his knees upon the floor and with the lantern and a magnifying lens began to examine minutely the cracks between the stones a few seconds sufficed to satisfy him for he sprang to his feet again and put his glass in his pocket we have at least an hour before us he remarked for they can hardly take any steps until the good pawnbroker is safely in bed then they will not lose a minute for the sooner they do their work the longer time they will have for their escape we are at present doctor as no doubt you have divined in the cellar of the city branch of one of the principal london banks mr merryweather is the chairman of directors and he will explain to you that there are reasons why the more daring criminals of london should take a considerable interest in this cellar at present it is our french gold whispered the director we have had several warnings that an attempt might be made upon it your french gold yes we had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources and borrowed for that purpose napoleons from the bank of france it has become known that we have never had occasion to unpack the money and that it is still lying in our cellar the crate upon which i sit contains napoleons packed between layers of lead foil our reserve of bullion is much larger at present than is usually kept in a single branch office and the directors have had misgivings upon the subject which were very well justified observed holmes and now it is time that we arranged our little plans i expect that within an hour matters will come to a head in the meantime mr merryweather we must put the screen over that dark lantern and sit in the dark i am afraid so i had brought a pack of cards in my pocket and i thought that as we were a partie carr e you might have your rubber after all but i see that the enemy s preparations have gone so far that we cannot risk the presence of a light and first of all we must choose our positions these are daring men and though we shall take them at a disadvantage they may do us some harm unless we are careful i shall stand behind this crate and do you conceal yourselves behind those then when i flash a light upon them close in swiftly if they fire watson have no compunction about shooting them down i placed my revolver cocked upon the top of the wooden case behind which i crouched holmes shot the slide across the front of his lantern and left us in pitch darkness such an absolute darkness as i have never before experienced the smell of hot metal remained to assure us that the light was still there ready to flash out at a moment s notice to me with my nerves worked up to a pitch of expectancy there was something depressing and subduing in the sudden gloom and in the cold dank air of the vault they have but one retreat whispered holmes that is back through the house into saxe coburg square i hope that you have done what i asked you jones i have an inspector and two officers waiting at the front door then we have stopped all the holes and now we must be silent and wait what a time it seemed from comparing notes afterwards it was but an hour and a quarter yet it appeared to me that the night must have almost gone and the dawn be breaking above us my limbs were weary and stiff for i feared to change my position yet my nerves were worked up to the highest pitch of tension and my hearing was so acute that i could not only hear the gentle breathing of my companions but i could distinguish the deeper heavier in breath of the bulky jones from the thin sighing note of the bank director from my position i could look over the case in the direction of the floor suddenly my eyes caught the glint of a light at first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement then it lengthened out until it became a yellow line and then without any warning or sound a gash seemed to open and a hand appeared a white almost womanly hand which felt about in the centre of the little area of light for a minute or more the hand with its writhing fingers protruded out of the floor then it was withdrawn as suddenly as it appeared and all was dark again save the single lurid spark which marked a chink between the stones its disappearance however was but momentary with a rending tearing sound one of the broad white stones turned over upon its side and left a square gaping hole through which streamed the light of a lantern over the edge there peeped a clean cut boyish face which looked keenly about it and then with a hand on either side of the aperture drew itself shoulder high and waist high until one knee rested upon the edge in another instant he stood at the side of the hole and was hauling after him a companion lithe and small like himself with a pale face and a shock of very red hair it s all clear he whispered have you the chisel and the bags great scott jump archie jump and i ll swing for it sherlock holmes had sprung out and seized the intruder by the collar the other dived down the hole and i heard the sound of rending cloth as jones clutched at his skirts the light flashed upon the barrel of a revolver but holmes hunting crop came down on the man s wrist and the pistol clinked upon the stone floor it s no use john clay said holmes blandly you have no chance at all so i see the other answered with the utmost coolness i fancy that my pal is all right though i see you have got his coat tails there are three men waiting for him at the door said holmes oh indeed you seem to have done the thing very completely i must compliment you and i you holmes answered your red headed idea was very new and effective you ll see your pal again presently said jones he s quicker at climbing down holes than i am just hold out while i fix the derbies i beg that you will not touch me with your filthy hands remarked our prisoner as the handcuffs clattered upon his wrists you may not be aware that i have royal blood in my veins have the goodness also when you address me always to say sir and please all right said jones with a stare and a snigger well would you please sir march upstairs where we can get a cab to carry your highness to the police station that is better said john clay serenely he made a sweeping bow to the three of us and walked quietly off in the custody of the detective really mr holmes said mr merryweather as we followed them from the cellar i do not know how the bank can thank you or repay you there is no doubt that you have detected and defeated in the most complete manner one of the most determined attempts at bank robbery that have ever come within my experience i have had one or two little scores of my own to settle with mr john clay said holmes i have been at some small expense over this matter which i shall expect the bank to refund but beyond that i am amply repaid by having had an experience which is in many ways unique and by hearing the very remarkable narrative of the red headed league you see watson he explained in the early hours of the morning as we sat over a glass of whisky and soda in baker street it was perfectly obvious from the first that the only possible object of this rather fantastic business of the advertisement of the league and the copying of the encyclop dia must be to get this not over bright pawnbroker out of the way for a number of hours every day it was a curious way of managing it but really it would be difficult to suggest a better the method was no doubt suggested to clay s ingenious mind by the colour of his accomplice s hair the a week was a lure which must draw him and what was it to them who were playing for thousands they put in the advertisement one rogue has the temporary office the other rogue incites the man to apply for it and together they manage to secure his absence every morning in the week from the time that i heard of the assistant having come for half wages it was obvious to me that he had some strong motive for securing the situation but how could you guess what the motive was had there been women in the house i should have suspected a mere vulgar intrigue that however was out of the question the man s business was a small one and there was nothing in his house which could account for such elaborate preparations and such an expenditure as they were at it must then be something out of the house what could it be i thought of the assistant s fondness for photography and his trick of vanishing into the cellar the cellar there was the end of this tangled clue then i made inquiries as to this mysterious assistant and found that i had to deal with one of the coolest and most daring criminals in london he was doing something in the cellar something which took many hours a day for months on end what could it be once more i could think of nothing save that he was running a tunnel to some other building so far i had got when we went to visit the scene of action i surprised you by beating upon the pavement with my stick i was ascertaining whether the cellar stretched out in front or behind it was not in front then i rang the bell and as i hoped the assistant answered it we have had some skirmishes but we had never set eyes upon each other before i hardly looked at his face his knees were what i wished to see you must yourself have remarked how worn wrinkled and stained they were they spoke of those hours of burrowing the only remaining point was what they were burrowing for i walked round the corner saw the city and suburban bank abutted on our friend s premises and felt that i had solved my problem when you drove home after the concert i called upon scotland yard and upon the chairman of the bank directors with the result that you have seen and how could you tell that they would make their attempt to night i asked well when they closed their league offices that was a sign that they cared no longer about mr jabez wilson s presence in other words that they had completed their tunnel but it was essential that they should use it soon as it might be discovered or the bullion might be removed saturday would suit them better than any other day as it would give them two days for their escape for all these reasons i expected them to come to night you reasoned it out beautifully i exclaimed in unfeigned admiration it is so long a chain and yet every link rings true it saved me from ennui he answered yawning alas i already feel it closing in upon me my life is spent in one long effort to escape from the commonplaces of existence these little problems help me to do so and you are a benefactor of the race said i he shrugged his shoulders well perhaps after all it is of some little use he remarked l homme c est rien l uvre c est tout as gustave flaubert wrote to george sand iii a case of identity my dear fellow said sherlock holmes as we sat on either side of the fire in his lodgings at baker street life is infinitely stranger than anything which the mind of man could invent we would not dare to conceive the things which are really mere commonplaces of existence if we could fly out of that window hand in hand hover over this great city gently remove the roofs and peep in at the queer things which are going on the strange coincidences the plannings the cross purposes the wonderful chains of events working through generations and leading to the most outr results it would make all fiction with its conventionalities and foreseen conclusions most stale and unprofitable and yet i am not convinced of it i answered the cases which come to light in the papers are as a rule bald enough and vulgar enough we have in our police reports realism pushed to its extreme limits and yet the result is it must be confessed neither fascinating nor artistic a certain selection and discretion must be used in producing a realistic effect remarked holmes this is wanting in the police report where more stress is laid perhaps upon the platitudes of the magistrate than upon the details which to an observer contain the vital essence of the whole matter depend upon it there is nothing so unnatural as the commonplace i smiled and shook my head i can quite understand your thinking so i said of course in your position of unofficial adviser and helper to everybody who is absolutely puzzled throughout three continents you are brought in contact with all that is strange and bizarre but here i picked up the morning paper from the ground let us put it to a practical test here is the first heading upon which i come a husband s cruelty to his wife there is half a column of print but i know without reading it that it is all perfectly familiar to me there is of course the other woman the drink the push the blow the bruise the sympathetic sister or landlady the crudest of writers could invent nothing more crude indeed your example is an unfortunate one for your argument said holmes taking the paper and glancing his eye down it this is the dundas separation case and as it happens i was engaged in clearing up some small points in connection with it the husband was a teetotaler there was no other woman and the conduct complained of was that he had drifted into the habit of winding up every meal by taking out his false teeth and hurling them at his wife which you will allow is not an action likely to occur to the imagination of the average story teller take a pinch of snuff doctor and acknowledge that i have scored over you in your example he held out his snuffbox of old gold with a great amethyst in the centre of the lid its splendour was in such contrast to his homely ways and simple life that i could not help commenting upon it ah said he i forgot that i had not seen you for some weeks it is a little souvenir from the king of bohemia in return for my assistance in the case of the irene adler papers and the ring i asked glancing at a remarkable brilliant which sparkled upon his finger it was from the reigning family of holland though the matter in which i served them was of such delicacy that i cannot confide it even to you who have been good enough to chronicle one or two of my little problems and have you any on hand just now i asked with interest some ten or twelve but none which present any feature of interest they are important you understand without being interesting indeed i have found that it is usually in unimportant matters that there is a field for the observation and for the quick analysis of cause and effect which gives the charm to an investigation the larger crimes are apt to be the simpler for the bigger the crime the more obvious as a rule is the motive in these cases save for one rather intricate matter which has been referred to me from marseilles there is nothing which presents any features of interest it is possible however that i may have something better before very many minutes are over for this is one of my clients or i am much mistaken he had risen from his chair and was standing between the parted blinds gazing down into the dull neutral tinted london street looking over his shoulder i saw that on the pavement opposite there stood a large woman with a heavy fur boa round her neck and a large curling red feather in a broad brimmed hat which was tilted in a coquettish duchess of devonshire fashion over her ear from under this great panoply she peeped up in a nervous hesitating fashion at our windows while her body oscillated backward and forward and her fingers fidgeted with her glove buttons suddenly with a plunge as of the swimmer who leaves the bank she hurried across the road and we heard the sharp clang of the bell i have seen those symptoms before said holmes throwing his cigarette into the fire oscillation upon the pavement always means an affaire de c ur she would like advice but is not sure that the matter is not too delicate for communication and yet even here we may discriminate when a woman has been seriously wronged by a man she no longer oscillates and the usual symptom is a broken bell wire here we may take it that there is a love matter but that the maiden is not so much angry as perplexed or grieved but here she comes in person to resolve our doubts as he spoke there was a tap at the door and the boy in buttons entered to announce miss mary sutherland while the lady herself loomed behind his small black figure like a full sailed merchant man behind a tiny pilot boat sherlock holmes welcomed her with the easy courtesy for which he was remarkable and having closed the door and bowed her into an armchair he looked her over in the minute and yet abstracted fashion which was peculiar to him do you not find he said that with your short sight it is a little trying to do so much typewriting i did at first she answered but now i know where the letters are without looking then suddenly realising the full purport of his words she gave a violent start and looked up with fear and astonishment upon her broad good humoured face you ve heard about me mr holmes she cried else how could you know all that never mind said holmes laughing it is my business to know things perhaps i have trained myself to see what others overlook if not why should you come to consult me i came to you sir because i heard of you from mrs etherege whose husband you found so easy when the police and everyone had given him up for dead oh mr holmes i wish you would do as much for me i m not rich but still i have a hundred a year in my own right besides the little that i make by the machine and i would give it all to know what has become of mr hosmer angel why did you come away to consult me in such a hurry asked sherlock holmes with his finger tips together and his eyes to the ceiling again a startled look came over the somewhat vacuous face of miss mary sutherland yes i did bang out of the house she said for it made me angry to see the easy way in which mr windibank that is my father took it all he would not go to the police and he would not go to you and so at last as he would do nothing and kept on saying that there was no harm done it made me mad and i just on with my things and came right away to you your father said holmes your stepfather surely since the name is different yes my stepfather i call him father though it sounds funny too for he is only five years and two months older than myself and your mother is alive oh yes mother is alive and well i wasn t best pleased mr holmes when she married again so soon after father s death and a man who was nearly fifteen years younger than herself father was a plumber in the tottenham court road and he left a tidy business behind him which mother carried on with mr hardy the foreman but when mr windibank came he made her sell the business for he was very superior being a traveller in wines they got for the goodwill and interest which wasn t near as much as father could have got if he had been alive i had expected to see sherlock holmes impatient under this rambling and inconsequential narrative but on the contrary he had listened with the greatest concentration of attention your own little income he asked does it come out of the business oh no sir it is quite separate and was left me by my uncle ned in auckland it is in new zealand stock paying per cent two thousand five hundred pounds was the amount but i can only touch the interest you interest me extremely said holmes and since you draw so large a sum as a hundred a year with what you earn into the bargain you no doubt travel a little and indulge yourself in every way i believe that a single lady can get on very nicely upon an income of about i could do with much less than that mr holmes but you understand that as long as i live at home i don t wish to be a burden to them and so they have the use of the money just while i am staying with them of course that is only just for the time mr windibank draws my interest every quarter and pays it over to mother and i find that i can do pretty well with what i earn at typewriting it brings me twopence a sheet and i can often do from fifteen to twenty sheets in a day you have made your position very clear to me said holmes this is my friend dr watson before whom you can speak as freely as before myself kindly tell us now all about your connection with mr hosmer angel a flush stole over miss sutherland s face and she picked nervously at the fringe of her jacket i met him first at the gasfitters ball she said they used to send father tickets when he was alive and then afterwards they remembered us and sent them to mother mr windibank did not wish us to go he never did wish us to go anywhere he would get quite mad if i wanted so much as to join a sunday school treat but this time i was set on going and i would go for what right had he to prevent he said the folk were not fit for us to know when all father s friends were to be there and he said that i had nothing fit to wear when i had my purple plush that i had never so much as taken out of the drawer at last when nothing else would do he went off to france upon the business of the firm but we went mother and i with mr hardy who used to be our foreman and it was there i met mr hosmer angel i suppose said holmes that when mr windibank came back from france he was very annoyed at your having gone to the ball oh well he was very good about it he laughed i remember and shrugged his shoulders and said there was no use denying anything to a woman for she would have her way i see then at the gasfitters ball you met as i understand a gentleman called mr hosmer angel yes sir i met him that night and he called next day to ask if we had got home all safe and after that we met him that is to say mr holmes i met him twice for walks but after that father came back again and mr hosmer angel could not come to the house any more no well you know father didn t like anything of the sort he wouldn t have any visitors if he could help it and he used to say that a woman should be happy in her own family circle but then as i used to say to mother a woman wants her own circle to begin with and i had not got mine yet but how about mr hosmer angel did he make no attempt to see you well father was going off to france again in a week and hosmer wrote and said that it would be safer and better not to see each other until he had gone we could write in the meantime and he used to write every day i took the letters in in the morning so there was no need for father to know were you engaged to the gentleman at this time oh yes mr holmes we were engaged after the first walk that we took hosmer mr angel was a cashier in an office in leadenhall street and what office that s the worst of it mr holmes i don t know where did he live then he slept on the premises and you don t know his address no except that it was leadenhall street where did you address your letters then to the leadenhall street post office to be left till called for he said that if they were sent to the office he would be chaffed by all the other clerks about having letters from a lady so i offered to typewrite them like he did his but he wouldn t have that for he said that when i wrote them they seemed to come from me but when they were typewritten he always felt that the machine had come between us that will just show you how fond he was of me mr holmes and the little things that he would think of it was most suggestive said holmes it has long been an axiom of mine that the little things are infinitely the most important can you remember any other little things about mr hosmer angel he was a very shy man mr holmes he would rather walk with me in the evening than in the daylight for he said that he hated to be conspicuous very retiring and gentlemanly he was even his voice was gentle he d had the quinsy and swollen glands when he was young he told me and it had left him with a weak throat and a hesitating whispering fashion of speech he was always well dressed very neat and plain but his eyes were weak just as mine are and he wore tinted glasses against the glare well and what happened when mr windibank your stepfather returned to france mr hosmer angel came to the house again and proposed that we should marry before father came back he was in dreadful earnest and made me swear with my hands on the testament that whatever happened i would always be true to him mother said he was quite right to make me swear and that it was a sign of his passion mother was all in his favour from the first and was even fonder of him than i was then when they talked of marrying within the week i began to ask about father but they both said never to mind about father but just to tell him afterwards and mother said she would make it all right with him i didn t quite like that mr holmes it seemed funny that i should ask his leave as he was only a few years older than me but i didn t want to do anything on the sly so i wrote to father at bordeaux where the company has its french offices but the letter came back to me on the very morning of the wedding it missed him then yes sir for he had started to england just before it arrived ha that was unfortunate your wedding was arranged then for the friday was it to be in church yes sir but very quietly it was to be at st saviour s near king s cross and we were to have breakfast afterwards at the st pancras hotel hosmer came for us in a hansom but as there were two of us he put us both into it and stepped himself into a four wheeler which happened to be the only other cab in the street we got to the church first and when the four wheeler drove up we waited for him to step out but he never did and when the cabman got down from the box and looked there was no one there the cabman said that he could not imagine what had become of him for he had seen him get in with his own eyes that was last friday mr holmes and i have never seen or heard anything since then to throw any light upon what became of him it seems to me that you have been very shamefully treated said holmes oh no sir he was too good and kind to leave me so why all the morning he was saying to me that whatever happened i was to be true and that even if something quite unforeseen occurred to separate us i was always to remember that i was pledged to him and that he would claim his pledge sooner or later it seemed strange talk for a wedding morning but what has happened since gives a meaning to it most certainly it does your own opinion is then that some unforeseen catastrophe has occurred to him yes sir i believe that he foresaw some danger or else he would not have talked so and then i think that what he foresaw happened but you have no notion as to what it could have been none one more question how did your mother take the matter she was angry and said that i was never to speak of the matter again and your father did you tell him yes and he seemed to think with me that something had happened and that i should hear of hosmer again as he said what interest could anyone have in bringing me to the doors of the church and then leaving me now if he had borrowed my money or if he had married me and got my money settled on him there might be some reason but hosmer was very independent about money and never would look at a shilling of mine and yet what could have happened and why could he not write oh it drives me half mad to think of it and i can t sleep a wink at night she pulled a little handkerchief out of her muff and began to sob heavily into it i shall glance into the case for you said holmes rising and i have no doubt that we shall reach some definite result let the weight of the matter rest upon me now and do not let your mind dwell upon it further above all try to let mr hosmer angel vanish from your memory as he has done from your life then you don t think i ll see him again i fear not then what has happened to him you will leave that question in my hands i should like an accurate description of him and any letters of his which you can spare i advertised for him in last saturday s chronicle said she here is the slip and here are four letters from him thank you and your address no lyon place camberwell mr angel s address you never had i understand where is your father s place of business he travels for westhouse marbank the great claret importers of fenchurch street thank you you have made your statement very clearly you will leave the papers here and remember the advice which i have given you let the whole incident be a sealed book and do not allow it to affect your life you are very kind mr holmes but i cannot do that i shall be true to hosmer he shall find me ready when he comes back for all the preposterous hat and the vacuous face there was something noble in the simple faith of our visitor which compelled our respect she laid her little bundle of papers upon the table and went her way with a promise to come again whenever she might be summoned sherlock holmes sat silent for a few minutes with his fingertips still pressed together his legs stretched out in front of him and his gaze directed upward to the ceiling then he took down from the rack the old and oily clay pipe which was to him as a counsellor and having lit it he leaned back in his chair with the thick blue cloud wreaths spinning up from him and a look of infinite languor in his face quite an interesting study that maiden he observed i found her more interesting than her little problem which by the way is rather a trite one you will find parallel cases if you consult my index in andover in and there was something of the sort at the hague last year old as is the idea however there were one or two details which were new to me but the maiden herself was most instructive you appeared to read a good deal upon her which was quite invisible to me i remarked not invisible but unnoticed watson you did not know where to look and so you missed all that was important i can never bring you to realise the importance of sleeves the suggestiveness of thumb nails or the great issues that may hang from a boot lace now what did you gather from that woman s appearance describe it well she had a slate coloured broad brimmed straw hat with a feather of a brickish red her jacket was black with black beads sewn upon it and a fringe of little black jet ornaments her dress was brown rather darker than coffee colour with a little purple plush at the neck and sleeves her gloves were greyish and were worn through at the right forefinger her boots i didn t observe she had small round hanging gold earrings and a general air of being fairly well to do in a vulgar comfortable easy going way sherlock holmes clapped his hands softly together and chuckled pon my word watson you are coming along wonderfully you have really done very well indeed it is true that you have missed everything of importance but you have hit upon the method and you have a quick eye for colour never trust to general impressions my boy but concentrate yourself upon details my first glance is always at a woman s sleeve in a man it is perhaps better first to take the knee of the trouser as you observe this woman had plush upon her sleeves which is a most useful material for showing traces the double line a little above the wrist where the typewritist presses against the table was beautifully defined the sewing machine of the hand type leaves a similar mark but only on the left arm and on the side of it farthest from the thumb instead of being right across the broadest part as this was i then glanced at her face and observing the dint of a pince nez at either side of her nose i ventured a remark upon short sight and typewriting which seemed to surprise her it surprised me but surely it was obvious i was then much surprised and interested on glancing down to observe that though the boots which she was wearing were not unlike each other they were really odd ones the one having a slightly decorated toe cap and the other a plain one one was buttoned only in the two lower buttons out of five and the other at the first third and fifth now when you see that a young lady otherwise neatly dressed has come away from home with odd boots half buttoned it is no great deduction to say that she came away in a hurry and what else i asked keenly interested as i always was by my friend s incisive reasoning i noted in passing that she had written a note before leaving home but after being fully dressed you observed that her right glove was torn at the forefinger but you did not apparently see that both glove and finger were stained with violet ink she had written in a hurry and dipped her pen too deep it must have been this morning or the mark would not remain clear upon the finger all this is amusing though rather elementary but i must go back to business watson would you mind reading me the advertised description of mr hosmer angel i held the little printed slip to the light missing it said on the morning of the fourteenth a gentleman named hosmer angel about five ft seven in in height strongly built sallow complexion black hair a little bald in the centre bushy black side whiskers and moustache tinted glasses slight infirmity of speech was dressed when last seen in black frock coat faced with silk black waistcoat gold albert chain and grey harris tweed trousers with brown gaiters over elastic sided boots known to have been employed in an office in leadenhall street anybody bringing c c that will do said holmes as to the letters he continued glancing over them they are very commonplace absolutely no clue in them to mr angel save that he quotes balzac once there is one remarkable point however which will no doubt strike you they are typewritten i remarked not only that but the signature is typewritten look at the neat little hosmer angel at the bottom there is a date you see but no superscription except leadenhall street which is rather vague the point about the signature is very suggestive in fact we may call it conclusive of what my dear fellow is it possible you do not see how strongly it bears upon the case i cannot say that i do unless it were that he wished to be able to deny his signature if an action for breach of promise were instituted no that was not the point however i shall write two letters which should settle the matter one is to a firm in the city the other is to the young lady s stepfather mr windibank asking him whether he could meet us here at six o clock to morrow evening it is just as well that we should do business with the male relatives and now doctor we can do nothing until the answers to those letters come so we may put our little problem upon the shelf for the interim i had had so many reasons to believe in my friend s subtle powers of reasoning and extraordinary energy in action that i felt that he must have some solid grounds for the assured and easy demeanour with which he treated the singular mystery which he had been called upon to fathom once only had i known him to fail in the case of the king of bohemia and of the irene adler photograph but when i looked back to the weird business of the sign of four and the extraordinary circumstances connected with the study in scarlet i felt that it would be a strange tangle indeed which he could not unravel i left him then still puffing at his black clay pipe with the conviction that when i came again on the next evening i would find that he held in his hands all the clues which would lead up to the identity of the disappearing bridegroom of miss mary sutherland a professional case of great gravity was engaging my own attention at the time and the whole of next day i was busy at the bedside of the sufferer it was not until close upon six o clock that i found myself free and was able to spring into a hansom and drive to baker street half afraid that i might be too late to assist at the d nouement of the little mystery i found sherlock holmes alone however half asleep with his long thin form curled up in the recesses of his armchair a formidable array of bottles and test tubes with the pungent cleanly smell of hydrochloric acid told me that he had spent his day in the chemical work which was so dear to him well have you solved it i asked as i entered yes it was the bisulphate of baryta no no the mystery i cried oh that i thought of the salt that i have been working upon there was never any mystery in the matter though as i said yesterday some of the details are of interest the only drawback is that there is no law i fear that can touch the scoundrel who was he then and what was his object in deserting miss sutherland the question was hardly out of my mouth and holmes had not yet opened his lips to reply when we heard a heavy footfall in the passage and a tap at the door this is the girl s stepfather mr james windibank said holmes he has written to me to say that he would be here at six come in the man who entered was a sturdy middle sized fellow some thirty years of age clean shaven and sallow skinned with a bland insinuating manner and a pair of wonderfully sharp and penetrating grey eyes he shot a questioning glance at each of us placed his shiny top hat upon the sideboard and with a slight bow sidled down into the nearest chair good evening mr james windibank said holmes i think that this typewritten letter is from you in which you made an appointment with me for six o clock yes sir i am afraid that i am a little late but i am not quite my own master you know i am sorry that miss sutherland has troubled you about this little matter for i think it is far better not to wash linen of the sort in public it was quite against my wishes that she came but she is a very excitable impulsive girl as you may have noticed and she is not easily controlled when she has made up her mind on a point of course i did not mind you so much as you are not connected with the official police but it is not pleasant to have a family misfortune like this noised abroad besides it is a useless expense for how could you possibly find this hosmer angel on the contrary said holmes quietly i have every reason to believe that i will succeed in discovering mr hosmer angel mr windibank gave a violent start and dropped his gloves i am delighted to hear it he said it is a curious thing remarked holmes that a typewriter has really quite as much individuality as a man s handwriting unless they are quite new no two of them write exactly alike some letters get more worn than others and some wear only on one side now you remark in this note of yours mr windibank that in every case there is some little slurring over of the e and a slight defect in the tail of the r there are fourteen other characteristics but those are the more obvious we do all our correspondence with this machine at the office and no doubt it is a little worn our visitor answered glancing keenly at holmes with his bright little eyes and now i will show you what is really a very interesting study mr windibank holmes continued i think of writing another little monograph some of these days on the typewriter and its relation to crime it is a subject to which i have devoted some little attention i have here four letters which purport to come from the missing man they are all typewritten in each case not only are the e s slurred and the r s tailless but you will observe if you care to use my magnifying lens that the fourteen other characteristics to which i have alluded are there as well mr windibank sprang out of his chair and picked up his hat i cannot waste time over this sort of fantastic talk mr holmes he said if you can catch the man catch him and let me know when you have done it certainly said holmes stepping over and turning the key in the door i let you know then that i have caught him what where shouted mr windibank turning white to his lips and glancing about him like a rat in a trap oh it won t do really it won t said holmes suavely there is no possible getting out of it mr windibank it is quite too transparent and it was a very bad compliment when you said that it was impossible for me to solve so simple a question that s right sit down and let us talk it over our visitor collapsed into a chair with a ghastly face and a glitter of moisture on his brow it it s not actionable he stammered i am very much afraid that it is not but between ourselves windibank it was as cruel and selfish and heartless a trick in a petty way as ever came before me now let me just run over the course of events and you will contradict me if i go wrong the man sat huddled up in his chair with his head sunk upon his breast like one who is utterly crushed holmes stuck his feet up on the corner of the mantelpiece and leaning back with his hands in his pockets began talking rather to himself as it seemed than to us the man married a woman very much older than himself for her money said he and he enjoyed the use of the money of the daughter as long as she lived with them it was a considerable sum for people in their position and the loss of it would have made a serious difference it was worth an effort to preserve it the daughter was of a good amiable disposition but affectionate and warm hearted in her ways so that it was evident that with her fair personal advantages and her little income she would not be allowed to remain single long now her marriage would mean of course the loss of a hundred a year so what does her stepfather do to prevent it he takes the obvious course of keeping her at home and forbidding her to seek the company of people of her own age but soon he found that that would not answer forever she became restive insisted upon her rights and finally announced her positive intention of going to a certain ball what does her clever stepfather do then he conceives an idea more creditable to his head than to his heart with the connivance and assistance of his wife he disguised himself covered those keen eyes with tinted glasses masked the face with a moustache and a pair of bushy whiskers sunk that clear voice into an insinuating whisper and doubly secure on account of the girl s short sight he appears as mr hosmer angel and keeps off other lovers by making love himself it was only a joke at first groaned our visitor we never thought that she would have been so carried away very likely not however that may be the young lady was very decidedly carried away and having quite made up her mind that her stepfather was in france the suspicion of treachery never for an instant entered her mind she was flattered by the gentleman s attentions and the effect was increased by the loudly expressed admiration of her mother then mr angel began to call for it was obvious that the matter should be pushed as far as it would go if a real effect were to be produced there were meetings and an engagement which would finally secure the girl s affections from turning towards anyone else but the deception could not be kept up forever these pretended journeys to france were rather cumbrous the thing to do was clearly to bring the business to an end in such a dramatic manner that it would leave a permanent impression upon the young lady s mind and prevent her from looking upon any other suitor for some time to come hence those vows of fidelity exacted upon a testament and hence also the allusions to a possibility of something happening on the very morning of the wedding james windibank wished miss sutherland to be so bound to hosmer angel and so uncertain as to his fate that for ten years to come at any rate she would not listen to another man as far as the church door he brought her and then as he could go no farther he conveniently vanished away by the old trick of stepping in at one door of a four wheeler and out at the other i think that was the chain of events mr windibank our visitor had recovered something of his assurance while holmes had been talking and he rose from his chair now with a cold sneer upon his pale face it may be so or it may not mr holmes said he but if you are so very sharp you ought to be sharp enough to know that it is you who are breaking the law now and not me i have done nothing actionable from the first but as long as you keep that door locked you lay yourself open to an action for assault and illegal constraint the law cannot as you say touch you said holmes unlocking and throwing open the door yet there never was a man who deserved punishment more if the young lady has a brother or a friend he ought to lay a whip across your shoulders by jove he continued flushing up at the sight of the bitter sneer upon the man s face it is not part of my duties to my client but here s a hunting crop handy and i think i shall just treat myself to he took two swift steps to the whip but before he could grasp it there was a wild clatter of steps upon the stairs the heavy hall door banged and from the window we could see mr james windibank running at the top of his speed down the road there s a cold blooded scoundrel said holmes laughing as he threw himself down into his chair once more that fellow will rise from crime to crime until he does something very bad and ends on a gallows the case has in some respects been not entirely devoid of interest i cannot now entirely see all the steps of your reasoning i remarked well of course it was obvious from the first that this mr hosmer angel must have some strong object for his curious conduct and it was equally clear that the only man who really profited by the incident as far as we could see was the stepfather then the fact that the two men were never together but that the one always appeared when the other was away was suggestive so were the tinted spectacles and the curious voice which both hinted at a disguise as did the bushy whiskers my suspicions were all confirmed by his peculiar action in typewriting his signature which of course inferred that his handwriting was so familiar to her that she would recognise even the smallest sample of it you see all these isolated facts together with many minor ones all pointed in the same direction and how did you verify them having once spotted my man it was easy to get corroboration i knew the firm for which this man worked having taken the printed description i eliminated everything from it which could be the result of a disguise the whiskers the glasses the voice and i sent it to the firm with a request that they would inform me whether it answered to the description of any of their travellers i had already noticed the peculiarities of the typewriter and i wrote to the man himself at his business address asking him if he would come here as i expected his reply was typewritten and revealed the same trivial but characteristic defects the same post brought me a letter from westhouse marbank of fenchurch street to say that the description tallied in every respect with that of their employ james windibank voil tout and miss sutherland if i tell her she will not believe me you may remember the old persian saying there is danger for him who taketh the tiger cub and danger also for whoso snatches a delusion from a woman there is as much sense in hafiz as in horace and as much knowledge of the world iv the boscombe valley mystery we were seated at breakfast one morning my wife and i when the maid brought in a telegram it was from sherlock holmes and ran in this way have you a couple of days to spare have just been wired for from the west of england in connection with boscombe valley tragedy shall be glad if you will come with me air and scenery perfect leave paddington by the what do you say dear said my wife looking across at me will you go i really don t know what to say i have a fairly long list at present oh anstruther would do your work for you you have been looking a little pale lately i think that the change would do you good and you are always so interested in mr sherlock holmes cases i should be ungrateful if i were not seeing what i gained through one of them i answered but if i am to go i must pack at once for i have only half an hour my experience of camp life in afghanistan had at least had the effect of making me a prompt and ready traveller my wants were few and simple so that in less than the time stated i was in a cab with my valise rattling away to paddington station sherlock holmes was pacing up and down the platform his tall gaunt figure made even gaunter and taller by his long grey travelling cloak and close fitting cloth cap it is really very good of you to come watson said he it makes a considerable difference to me having someone with me on whom i can thoroughly rely local aid is always either worthless or else biassed if you will keep the two corner seats i shall get the tickets we had the carriage to ourselves save for an immense litter of papers which holmes had brought with him among these he rummaged and read with intervals of note taking and of meditation until we were past reading then he suddenly rolled them all into a gigantic ball and tossed them up onto the rack have you heard anything of the case he asked not a word i have not seen a paper for some days the london press has not had very full accounts i have just been looking through all the recent papers in order to master the particulars it seems from what i gather to be one of those simple cases which are so extremely difficult that sounds a little paradoxical but it is profoundly true singularity is almost invariably a clue the more featureless and commonplace a crime is the more difficult it is to bring it home in this case however they have established a very serious case against the son of the murdered man it is a murder then well it is conjectured to be so i shall take nothing for granted until i have the opportunity of looking personally into it i will explain the state of things to you as far as i have been able to understand it in a very few words boscombe valley is a country district not very far from ross in herefordshire the largest landed proprietor in that part is a mr john turner who made his money in australia and returned some years ago to the old country one of the farms which he held that of hatherley was let to mr charles mccarthy who was also an ex australian the men had known each other in the colonies so that it was not unnatural that when they came to settle down they should do so as near each other as possible turner was apparently the richer man so mccarthy became his tenant but still remained it seems upon terms of perfect equality as they were frequently together mccarthy had one son a lad of eighteen and turner had an only daughter of the same age but neither of them had wives living they appear to have avoided the society of the neighbouring english families and to have led retired lives though both the mccarthys were fond of sport and were frequently seen at the race meetings of the neighbourhood mccarthy kept two servants a man and a girl turner had a considerable household some half dozen at the least that is as much as i have been able to gather about the families now for the facts on june rd that is on monday last mccarthy left his house at hatherley about three in the afternoon and walked down to the boscombe pool which is a small lake formed by the spreading out of the stream which runs down the boscombe valley he had been out with his serving man in the morning at ross and he had told the man that he must hurry as he had an appointment of importance to keep at three from that appointment he never came back alive from hatherley farmhouse to the boscombe pool is a quarter of a mile and two people saw him as he passed over this ground one was an old woman whose name is not mentioned and the other was william crowder a game keeper in the employ of mr turner both these witnesses depose that mr mccarthy was walking alone the game keeper adds that within a few minutes of his seeing mr mccarthy pass he had seen his son mr james mccarthy going the same way with a gun under his arm to the best of his belief the father was actually in sight at the time and the son was following him he thought no more of the matter until he heard in the evening of the tragedy that had occurred the two mccarthys were seen after the time when william crowder the game keeper lost sight of them the boscombe pool is thickly wooded round with just a fringe of grass and of reeds round the edge a girl of fourteen patience moran who is the daughter of the lodge keeper of the boscombe valley estate was in one of the woods picking flowers she states that while she was there she saw at the border of the wood and close by the lake mr mccarthy and his son and that they appeared to be having a violent quarrel she heard mr mccarthy the elder using very strong language to his son and she saw the latter raise up his hand as if to strike his father she was so frightened by their violence that she ran away and told her mother when she reached home that she had left the two mccarthys quarrelling near boscombe pool and that she was afraid that they were going to fight she had hardly said the words when young mr mccarthy came running up to the lodge to say that he had found his father dead in the wood and to ask for the help of the lodge keeper he was much excited without either his gun or his hat and his right hand and sleeve were observed to be stained with fresh blood on following him they found the dead body stretched out upon the grass beside the pool the head had been beaten in by repeated blows of some heavy and blunt weapon the injuries were such as might very well have been inflicted by the butt end of his son s gun which was found lying on the grass within a few paces of the body under these circumstances the young man was instantly arrested and a verdict of wilful murder having been returned at the inquest on tuesday he was on wednesday brought before the magistrates at ross who have referred the case to the next assizes those are the main facts of the case as they came out before the coroner and the police court i could hardly imagine a more damning case i remarked if ever circumstantial evidence pointed to a criminal it does so here circumstantial evidence is a very tricky thing answered holmes thoughtfully it may seem to point very straight to one thing but if you shift your own point of view a little you may find it pointing in an equally uncompromising manner to something entirely different it must be confessed however that the case looks exceedingly grave against the young man and it is very possible that he is indeed the culprit there are several people in the neighbourhood however and among them miss turner the daughter of the neighbouring landowner who believe in his innocence and who have retained lestrade whom you may recollect in connection with the study in scarlet to work out the case in his interest lestrade being rather puzzled has referred the case to me and hence it is that two middle aged gentlemen are flying westward at fifty miles an hour instead of quietly digesting their breakfasts at home i am afraid said i that the facts are so obvious that you will find little credit to be gained out of this case there is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact he answered laughing besides we may chance to hit upon some other obvious facts which may have been by no means obvious to mr lestrade you know me too well to think that i am boasting when i say that i shall either confirm or destroy his theory by means which he is quite incapable of employing or even of understanding to take the first example to hand i very clearly perceive that in your bedroom the window is upon the right hand side and yet i question whether mr lestrade would have noted even so self evident a thing as that how on earth my dear fellow i know you well i know the military neatness which characterises you you shave every morning and in this season you shave by the sunlight but since your shaving is less and less complete as we get farther back on the left side until it becomes positively slovenly as we get round the angle of the jaw it is surely very clear that that side is less illuminated than the other i could not imagine a man of your habits looking at himself in an equal light and being satisfied with such a result i only quote this as a trivial example of observation and inference therein lies my m tier and it is just possible that it may be of some service in the investigation which lies before us there are one or two minor points which were brought out in the inquest and which are worth considering what are they it appears that his arrest did not take place at once but after the return to hatherley farm on the inspector of constabulary informing him that he was a prisoner he remarked that he was not surprised to hear it and that it was no more than his deserts this observation of his had the natural effect of removing any traces of doubt which might have remained in the minds of the coroner s jury it was a confession i ejaculated no for it was followed by a protestation of innocence coming on the top of such a damning series of events it was at least a most suspicious remark on the contrary said holmes it is the brightest rift which i can at present see in the clouds however innocent he might be he could not be such an absolute imbecile as not to see that the circumstances were very black against him had he appeared surprised at his own arrest or feigned indignation at it i should have looked upon it as highly suspicious because such surprise or anger would not be natural under the circumstances and yet might appear to be the best policy to a scheming man his frank acceptance of the situation marks him as either an innocent man or else as a man of considerable self restraint and firmness as to his remark about his deserts it was also not unnatural if you consider that he stood beside the dead body of his father and that there is no doubt that he had that very day so far forgotten his filial duty as to bandy words with him and even according to the little girl whose evidence is so important to raise his hand as if to strike him the self reproach and contrition which are displayed in his remark appear to me to be the signs of a healthy mind rather than of a guilty one i shook my head many men have been hanged on far slighter evidence i remarked so they have and many men have been wrongfully hanged what is the young man s own account of the matter it is i am afraid not very encouraging to his supporters though there are one or two points in it which are suggestive you will find it here and may read it for yourself he picked out from his bundle a copy of the local herefordshire paper and having turned down the sheet he pointed out the paragraph in which the unfortunate young man had given his own statement of what had occurred i settled myself down in the corner of the carriage and read it very carefully it ran in this way mr james mccarthy the only son of the deceased was then called and gave evidence as follows i had been away from home for three days at bristol and had only just returned upon the morning of last monday the rd my father was absent from home at the time of my arrival and i was informed by the maid that he had driven over to ross with john cobb the groom shortly after my return i heard the wheels of his trap in the yard and looking out of my window i saw him get out and walk rapidly out of the yard though i was not aware in which direction he was going i then took my gun and strolled out in the direction of the boscombe pool with the intention of visiting the rabbit warren which is upon the other side on my way i saw william crowder the game keeper as he had stated in his evidence but he is mistaken in thinking that i was following my father i had no idea that he was in front of me when about a hundred yards from the pool i heard a cry of cooee which was a usual signal between my father and myself i then hurried forward and found him standing by the pool he appeared to be much surprised at seeing me and asked me rather roughly what i was doing there a conversation ensued which led to high words and almost to blows for my father was a man of a very violent temper seeing that his passion was becoming ungovernable i left him and returned towards hatherley farm i had not gone more than yards however when i heard a hideous outcry behind me which caused me to run back again i found my father expiring upon the ground with his head terribly injured i dropped my gun and held him in my arms but he almost instantly expired i knelt beside him for some minutes and then made my way to mr turner s lodge keeper his house being the nearest to ask for assistance i saw no one near my father when i returned and i have no idea how he came by his injuries he was not a popular man being somewhat cold and forbidding in his manners but he had as far as i know no active enemies i know nothing further of the matter the coroner did your father make any statement to you before he died witness he mumbled a few words but i could only catch some allusion to a rat the coroner what did you understand by that witness it conveyed no meaning to me i thought that he was delirious the coroner what was the point upon which you and your father had this final quarrel witness i should prefer not to answer the coroner i am afraid that i must press it witness it is really impossible for me to tell you i can assure you that it has nothing to do with the sad tragedy which followed the coroner that is for the court to decide i need not point out to you that your refusal to answer will prejudice your case considerably in any future proceedings which may arise witness i must still refuse the coroner i understand that the cry of cooee was a common signal between you and your father witness it was the coroner how was it then that he uttered it before he saw you and before he even knew that you had returned from bristol witness with considerable confusion i do not know a juryman did you see nothing which aroused your suspicions when you returned on hearing the cry and found your father fatally injured witness nothing definite the coroner what do you mean witness i was so disturbed and excited as i rushed out into the open that i could think of nothing except of my father yet i have a vague impression that as i ran forward something lay upon the ground to the left of me it seemed to me to be something grey in colour a coat of some sort or a plaid perhaps when i rose from my father i looked round for it but it was gone do you mean that it disappeared before you went for help yes it was gone you cannot say what it was no i had a feeling something was there how far from the body a dozen yards or so and how far from the edge of the wood about the same then if it was removed it was while you were within a dozen yards of it yes but with my back towards it this concluded the examination of the witness i see said i as i glanced down the column that the coroner in his concluding remarks was rather severe upon young mccarthy he calls attention and with reason to the discrepancy about his father having signalled to him before seeing him also to his refusal to give details of his conversation with his father and his singular account of his father s dying words they are all as he remarks very much against the son holmes laughed softly to himself and stretched himself out upon the cushioned seat both you and the coroner have been at some pains said he to single out the very strongest points in the young man s favour don t you see that you alternately give him credit for having too much imagination and too little too little if he could not invent a cause of quarrel which would give him the sympathy of the jury too much if he evolved from his own inner consciousness anything so outr as a dying reference to a rat and the incident of the vanishing cloth no sir i shall approach this case from the point of view that what this young man says is true and we shall see whither that hypothesis will lead us and now here is my pocket petrarch and not another word shall i say of this case until we are on the scene of action we lunch at swindon and i see that we shall be there in twenty minutes it was nearly four o clock when we at last after passing through the beautiful stroud valley and over the broad gleaming severn found ourselves at the pretty little country town of ross a lean ferret like man furtive and sly looking was waiting for us upon the platform in spite of the light brown dustcoat and leather leggings which he wore in deference to his rustic surroundings i had no difficulty in recognising lestrade of scotland yard with him we drove to the hereford arms where a room had already been engaged for us i have ordered a carriage said lestrade as we sat over a cup of tea i knew your energetic nature and that you would not be happy until you had been on the scene of the crime it was very nice and complimentary of you holmes answered it is entirely a question of barometric pressure lestrade looked startled i do not quite follow he said how is the glass twenty nine i see no wind and not a cloud in the sky i have a caseful of cigarettes here which need smoking and the sofa is very much superior to the usual country hotel abomination i do not think that it is probable that i shall use the carriage to night lestrade laughed indulgently you have no doubt already formed your conclusions from the newspapers he said the case is as plain as a pikestaff and the more one goes into it the plainer it becomes still of course one can t refuse a lady and such a very positive one too she has heard of you and would have your opinion though i repeatedly told her that there was nothing which you could do which i had not already done why bless my soul here is her carriage at the door he had hardly spoken before there rushed into the room one of the most lovely young women that i have ever seen in my life her violet eyes shining her lips parted a pink flush upon her cheeks all thought of her natural reserve lost in her overpowering excitement and concern oh mr sherlock holmes she cried glancing from one to the other of us and finally with a woman s quick intuition fastening upon my companion i am so glad that you have come i have driven down to tell you so i know that james didn t do it i know it and i want you to start upon your work knowing it too never let yourself doubt upon that point we have known each other since we were little children and i know his faults as no one else does but he is too tender hearted to hurt a fly such a charge is absurd to anyone who really knows him i hope we may clear him miss turner said sherlock holmes you may rely upon my doing all that i can but you have read the evidence you have formed some conclusion do you not see some loophole some flaw do you not yourself think that he is innocent i think that it is very probable there now she cried throwing back her head and looking defiantly at lestrade you hear he gives me hopes lestrade shrugged his shoulders i am afraid that my colleague has been a little quick in forming his conclusions he said but he is right oh i know that he is right james never did it and about his quarrel with his father i am sure that the reason why he would not speak about it to the coroner was because i was concerned in it in what way asked holmes it is no time for me to hide anything james and his father had many disagreements about me mr mccarthy was very anxious that there should be a marriage between us james and i have always loved each other as brother and sister but of course he is young and has seen very little of life yet and and well he naturally did not wish to do anything like that yet so there were quarrels and this i am sure was one of them and your father asked holmes was he in favour of such a union no he was averse to it also no one but mr mccarthy was in favour of it a quick blush passed over her fresh young face as holmes shot one of his keen questioning glances at her thank you for this information said he may i see your father if i call to morrow i am afraid the doctor won t allow it the doctor yes have you not heard poor father has never been strong for years back but this has broken him down completely he has taken to his bed and dr willows says that he is a wreck and that his nervous system is shattered mr mccarthy was the only man alive who had known dad in the old days in victoria ha in victoria that is important yes at the mines quite so at the gold mines where as i understand mr turner made his money yes certainly thank you miss turner you have been of material assistance to me you will tell me if you have any news to morrow no doubt you will go to the prison to see james oh if you do mr holmes do tell him that i know him to be innocent i will miss turner i must go home now for dad is very ill and he misses me so if i leave him good bye and god help you in your undertaking she hurried from the room as impulsively as she had entered and we heard the wheels of her carriage rattle off down the street i am ashamed of you holmes said lestrade with dignity after a few minutes silence why should you raise up hopes which you are bound to disappoint i am not over tender of heart but i call it cruel i think that i see my way to clearing james mccarthy said holmes have you an order to see him in prison yes but only for you and me then i shall reconsider my resolution about going out we have still time to take a train to hereford and see him to night ample then let us do so watson i fear that you will find it very slow but i shall only be away a couple of hours i walked down to the station with them and then wandered through the streets of the little town finally returning to the hotel where i lay upon the sofa and tried to interest myself in a yellow backed novel the puny plot of the story was so thin however when compared to the deep mystery through which we were groping and i found my attention wander so continually from the action to the fact that i at last flung it across the room and gave myself up entirely to a consideration of the events of the day supposing that this unhappy young man s story were absolutely true then what hellish thing what absolutely unforeseen and extraordinary calamity could have occurred between the time when he parted from his father and the moment when drawn back by his screams he rushed into the glade it was something terrible and deadly what could it be might not the nature of the injuries reveal something to my medical instincts i rang the bell and called for the weekly county paper which contained a verbatim account of the inquest in the surgeon s deposition it was stated that the posterior third of the left parietal bone and the left half of the occipital bone had been shattered by a heavy blow from a blunt weapon i marked the spot upon my own head clearly such a blow must have been struck from behind that was to some extent in favour of the accused as when seen quarrelling he was face to face with his father still it did not go for very much for the older man might have turned his back before the blow fell still it might be worth while to call holmes attention to it then there was the peculiar dying reference to a rat what could that mean it could not be delirium a man dying from a sudden blow does not commonly become delirious no it was more likely to be an attempt to explain how he met his fate but what could it indicate i cudgelled my brains to find some possible explanation and then the incident of the grey cloth seen by young mccarthy if that were true the murderer must have dropped some part of his dress presumably his overcoat in his flight and must have had the hardihood to return and to carry it away at the instant when the son was kneeling with his back turned not a dozen paces off what a tissue of mysteries and improbabilities the whole thing was i did not wonder at lestrade s opinion and yet i had so much faith in sherlock holmes insight that i could not lose hope as long as every fresh fact seemed to strengthen his conviction of young mccarthy s innocence it was late before sherlock holmes returned he came back alone for lestrade was staying in lodgings in the town the glass still keeps very high he remarked as he sat down it is of importance that it should not rain before we are able to go over the ground on the other hand a man should be at his very best and keenest for such nice work as that and i did not wish to do it when fagged by a long journey i have seen young mccarthy and what did you learn from him nothing could he throw no light none at all i was inclined to think at one time that he knew who had done it and was screening him or her but i am convinced now that he is as puzzled as everyone else he is not a very quick witted youth though comely to look at and i should think sound at heart i cannot admire his taste i remarked if it is indeed a fact that he was averse to a marriage with so charming a young lady as this miss turner ah thereby hangs a rather painful tale this fellow is madly insanely in love with her but some two years ago when he was only a lad and before he really knew her for she had been away five years at a boarding school what does the idiot do but get into the clutches of a barmaid in bristol and marry her at a registry office no one knows a word of the matter but you can imagine how maddening it must be to him to be upbraided for not doing what he would give his very eyes to do but what he knows to be absolutely impossible it was sheer frenzy of this sort which made him throw his hands up into the air when his father at their last interview was goading him on to propose to miss turner on the other hand he had no means of supporting himself and his father who was by all accounts a very hard man would have thrown him over utterly had he known the truth it was with his barmaid wife that he had spent the last three days in bristol and his father did not know where he was mark that point it is of importance good has come out of evil however for the barmaid finding from the papers that he is in serious trouble and likely to be hanged has thrown him over utterly and has written to him to say that she has a husband already in the bermuda dockyard so that there is really no tie between them i think that that bit of news has consoled young mccarthy for all that he has suffered but if he is innocent who has done it ah who i would call your attention very particularly to two points one is that the murdered man had an appointment with someone at the pool and that the someone could not have been his son for his son was away and he did not know when he would return the second is that the murdered man was heard to cry cooee before he knew that his son had returned those are the crucial points upon which the case depends and now let us talk about george meredith if you please and we shall leave all minor matters until to morrow there was no rain as holmes had foretold and the morning broke bright and cloudless at nine o clock lestrade called for us with the carriage and we set off for hatherley farm and the boscombe pool there is serious news this morning lestrade observed it is said that mr turner of the hall is so ill that his life is despaired of an elderly man i presume said holmes about sixty but his constitution has been shattered by his life abroad and he has been in failing health for some time this business has had a very bad effect upon him he was an old friend of mccarthy s and i may add a great benefactor to him for i have learned that he gave him hatherley farm rent free indeed that is interesting said holmes oh yes in a hundred other ways he has helped him everybody about here speaks of his kindness to him really does it not strike you as a little singular that this mccarthy who appears to have had little of his own and to have been under such obligations to turner should still talk of marrying his son to turner s daughter who is presumably heiress to the estate and that in such a very cocksure manner as if it were merely a case of a proposal and all else would follow it is the more strange since we know that turner himself was averse to the idea the daughter told us as much do you not deduce something from that we have got to the deductions and the inferences said lestrade winking at me i find it hard enough to tackle facts holmes without flying away after theories and fancies you are right said holmes demurely you do find it very hard to tackle the facts anyhow i have grasped one fact which you seem to find it difficult to get hold of replied lestrade with some warmth and that is that mccarthy senior met his death from mccarthy junior and that all theories to the contrary are the merest moonshine well moonshine is a brighter thing than fog said holmes laughing but i am very much mistaken if this is not hatherley farm upon the left yes that is it it was a widespread comfortable looking building two storied slate roofed with great yellow blotches of lichen upon the grey walls the drawn blinds and the smokeless chimneys however gave it a stricken look as though the weight of this horror still lay heavy upon it we called at the door when the maid at holmes request showed us the boots which her master wore at the time of his death and also a pair of the son s though not the pair which he had then had having measured these very carefully from seven or eight different points holmes desired to be led to the court yard from which we all followed the winding track which led to boscombe pool sherlock holmes was transformed when he was hot upon such a scent as this men who had only known the quiet thinker and logician of baker street would have failed to recognise him his face flushed and darkened his brows were drawn into two hard black lines while his eyes shone out from beneath them with a steely glitter his face was bent downward his shoulders bowed his lips compressed and the veins stood out like whipcord in his long sinewy neck his nostrils seemed to dilate with a purely animal lust for the chase and his mind was so absolutely concentrated upon the matter before him that a question or remark fell unheeded upon his ears or at the most only provoked a quick impatient snarl in reply swiftly and silently he made his way along the track which ran through the meadows and so by way of the woods to the boscombe pool it was damp marshy ground as is all that district and there were marks of many feet both upon the path and amid the short grass which bounded it on either side sometimes holmes would hurry on sometimes stop dead and once he made quite a little detour into the meadow lestrade and i walked behind him the detective indifferent and contemptuous while i watched my friend with the interest which sprang from the conviction that every one of his actions was directed towards a definite end the boscombe pool which is a little reed girt sheet of water some fifty yards across is situated at the boundary between the hatherley farm and the private park of the wealthy mr turner above the woods which lined it upon the farther side we could see the red jutting pinnacles which marked the site of the rich landowner s dwelling on the hatherley side of the pool the woods grew very thick and there was a narrow belt of sodden grass twenty paces across between the edge of the trees and the reeds which lined the lake lestrade showed us the exact spot at which the body had been found and indeed so moist was the ground that i could plainly see the traces which had been left by the fall of the stricken man to holmes as i could see by his eager face and peering eyes very many other things were to be read upon the trampled grass he ran round like a dog who is picking up a scent and then turned upon my companion what did you go into the pool for he asked i fished about with a rake i thought there might be some weapon or other trace but how on earth oh tut tut i have no time that left foot of yours with its inward twist is all over the place a mole could trace it and there it vanishes among the reeds oh how simple it would all have been had i been here before they came like a herd of buffalo and wallowed all over it here is where the party with the lodge keeper came and they have covered all tracks for six or eight feet round the body but here are three separate tracks of the same feet he drew out a lens and lay down upon his waterproof to have a better view talking all the time rather to himself than to us these are young mccarthy s feet twice he was walking and once he ran swiftly so that the soles are deeply marked and the heels hardly visible that bears out his story he ran when he saw his father on the ground then here are the father s feet as he paced up and down what is this then it is the butt end of the gun as the son stood listening and this ha ha what have we here tiptoes tiptoes square too quite unusual boots they come they go they come again of course that was for the cloak now where did they come from he ran up and down sometimes losing sometimes finding the track until we were well within the edge of the wood and under the shadow of a great beech the largest tree in the neighbourhood holmes traced his way to the farther side of this and lay down once more upon his face with a little cry of satisfaction for a long time he remained there turning over the leaves and dried sticks gathering up what seemed to me to be dust into an envelope and examining with his lens not only the ground but even the bark of the tree as far as he could reach a jagged stone was lying among the moss and this also he carefully examined and retained then he followed a pathway through the wood until he came to the high road where all traces were lost it has been a case of considerable interest he remarked returning to his natural manner i fancy that this grey house on the right must be the lodge i think that i will go in and have a word with moran and perhaps write a little note having done that we may drive back to our luncheon you may walk to the cab and i shall be with you presently it was about ten minutes before we regained our cab and drove back into ross holmes still carrying with him the stone which he had picked up in the wood this may interest you lestrade he remarked holding it out the murder was done with it i see no marks there are none how do you know then the grass was growing under it it had only lain there a few days there was no sign of a place whence it had been taken it corresponds with the injuries there is no sign of any other weapon and the murderer is a tall man left handed limps with the right leg wears thick soled shooting boots and a grey cloak smokes indian cigars uses a cigar holder and carries a blunt pen knife in his pocket there are several other indications but these may be enough to aid us in our search lestrade laughed i am afraid that i am still a sceptic he said theories are all very well but we have to deal with a hard headed british jury nous verrons answered holmes calmly you work your own method and i shall work mine i shall be busy this afternoon and shall probably return to london by the evening train and leave your case unfinished no finished but the mystery it is solved who was the criminal then the gentleman i describe but who is he surely it would not be difficult to find out this is not such a populous neighbourhood lestrade shrugged his shoulders i am a practical man he said and i really cannot undertake to go about the country looking for a left handed gentleman with a game leg i should become the laughing stock of scotland yard all right said holmes quietly i have given you the chance here are your lodgings good bye i shall drop you a line before i leave having left lestrade at his rooms we drove to our hotel where we found lunch upon the table holmes was silent and buried in thought with a pained expression upon his face as one who finds himself in a perplexing position look here watson he said when the cloth was cleared just sit down in this chair and let me preach to you for a little i don t know quite what to do and i should value your advice light a cigar and let me expound pray do so well now in considering this case there are two points about young mccarthy s narrative which struck us both instantly although they impressed me in his favour and you against him one was the fact that his father should according to his account cry cooee before seeing him the other was his singular dying reference to a rat he mumbled several words you understand but that was all that caught the son s ear now from this double point our research must commence and we will begin it by presuming that what the lad says is absolutely true what of this cooee then well obviously it could not have been meant for the son the son as far as he knew was in bristol it was mere chance that he was within earshot the cooee was meant to attract the attention of whoever it was that he had the appointment with but cooee is a distinctly australian cry and one which is used between australians there is a strong presumption that the person whom mccarthy expected to meet him at boscombe pool was someone who had been in australia what of the rat then sherlock holmes took a folded paper from his pocket and flattened it out on the table this is a map of the colony of victoria he said i wired to bristol for it last night he put his hand over part of the map what do you read arat i read and now he raised his hand ballarat quite so that was the word the man uttered and of which his son only caught the last two syllables he was trying to utter the name of his murderer so and so of ballarat it is wonderful i exclaimed it is obvious and now you see i had narrowed the field down considerably the possession of a grey garment was a third point which granting the son s statement to be correct was a certainty we have come now out of mere vagueness to the definite conception of an australian from ballarat with a grey cloak certainly and one who was at home in the district for the pool can only be approached by the farm or by the estate where strangers could hardly wander quite so then comes our expedition of to day by an examination of the ground i gained the trifling details which i gave to that imbecile lestrade as to the personality of the criminal but how did you gain them you know my method it is founded upon the observation of trifles his height i know that you might roughly judge from the length of his stride his boots too might be told from their traces yes they were peculiar boots but his lameness the impression of his right foot was always less distinct than his left he put less weight upon it why because he limped he was lame but his left handedness you were yourself struck by the nature of the injury as recorded by the surgeon at the inquest the blow was struck from immediately behind and yet was upon the left side now how can that be unless it were by a left handed man he had stood behind that tree during the interview between the father and son he had even smoked there i found the ash of a cigar which my special knowledge of tobacco ashes enables me to pronounce as an indian cigar i have as you know devoted some attention to this and written a little monograph on the ashes of different varieties of pipe cigar and cigarette tobacco having found the ash i then looked round and discovered the stump among the moss where he had tossed it it was an indian cigar of the variety which are rolled in rotterdam and the cigar holder i could see that the end had not been in his mouth therefore he used a holder the tip had been cut off not bitten off but the cut was not a clean one so i deduced a blunt pen knife holmes i said you have drawn a net round this man from which he cannot escape and you have saved an innocent human life as truly as if you had cut the cord which was hanging him i see the direction in which all this points the culprit is mr john turner cried the hotel waiter opening the door of our sitting room and ushering in a visitor the man who entered was a strange and impressive figure his slow limping step and bowed shoulders gave the appearance of decrepitude and yet his hard deep lined craggy features and his enormous limbs showed that he was possessed of unusual strength of body and of character his tangled beard grizzled hair and outstanding drooping eyebrows combined to give an air of dignity and power to his appearance but his face was of an ashen white while his lips and the corners of his nostrils were tinged with a shade of blue it was clear to me at a glance that he was in the grip of some deadly and chronic disease pray sit down on the sofa said holmes gently you had my note yes the lodge keeper brought it up you said that you wished to see me here to avoid scandal i thought people would talk if i went to the hall and why did you wish to see me he looked across at my companion with despair in his weary eyes as though his question was already answered yes said holmes answering the look rather than the words it is so i know all about mccarthy the old man sank his face in his hands god help me he cried but i would not have let the young man come to harm i give you my word that i would have spoken out if it went against him at the assizes i am glad to hear you say so said holmes gravely i would have spoken now had it not been for my dear girl it would break her heart it will break her heart when she hears that i am arrested it may not come to that said holmes what i am no official agent i understand that it was your daughter who required my presence here and i am acting in her interests young mccarthy must be got off however i am a dying man said old turner i have had diabetes for years my doctor says it is a question whether i shall live a month yet i would rather die under my own roof than in a gaol holmes rose and sat down at the table with his pen in his hand and a bundle of paper before him just tell us the truth he said i shall jot down the facts you will sign it and watson here can witness it then i could produce your confession at the last extremity to save young mccarthy i promise you that i shall not use it unless it is absolutely needed it s as well said the old man it s a question whether i shall live to the assizes so it matters little to me but i should wish to spare alice the shock and now i will make the thing clear to you it has been a long time in the acting but will not take me long to tell you didn t know this dead man mccarthy he was a devil incarnate i tell you that god keep you out of the clutches of such a man as he his grip has been upon me these twenty years and he has blasted my life i ll tell you first how i came to be in his power it was in the early s at the diggings i was a young chap then hot blooded and reckless ready to turn my hand at anything i got among bad companions took to drink had no luck with my claim took to the bush and in a word became what you would call over here a highway robber there were six of us and we had a wild free life of it sticking up a station from time to time or stopping the wagons on the road to the diggings black jack of ballarat was the name i went under and our party is still remembered in the colony as the ballarat gang one day a gold convoy came down from ballarat to melbourne and we lay in wait for it and attacked it there were six troopers and six of us so it was a close thing but we emptied four of their saddles at the first volley three of our boys were killed however before we got the swag i put my pistol to the head of the wagon driver who was this very man mccarthy i wish to the lord that i had shot him then but i spared him though i saw his wicked little eyes fixed on my face as though to remember every feature we got away with the gold became wealthy men and made our way over to england without being suspected there i parted from my old pals and determined to settle down to a quiet and respectable life i bought this estate which chanced to be in the market and i set myself to do a little good with my money to make up for the way in which i had earned it i married too and though my wife died young she left me my dear little alice even when she was just a baby her wee hand seemed to lead me down the right path as nothing else had ever done in a word i turned over a new leaf and did my best to make up for the past all was going well when mccarthy laid his grip upon me i had gone up to town about an investment and i met him in regent street with hardly a coat to his back or a boot to his foot here we are jack says he touching me on the arm we ll be as good as a family to you there s two of us me and my son and you can have the keeping of us if you don t it s a fine law abiding country is england and there s always a policeman within hail well down they came to the west country there was no shaking them off and there they have lived rent free on my best land ever since there was no rest for me no peace no forgetfulness turn where i would there was his cunning grinning face at my elbow it grew worse as alice grew up for he soon saw i was more afraid of her knowing my past than of the police whatever he wanted he must have and whatever it was i gave him without question land money houses until at last he asked a thing which i could not give he asked for alice his son you see had grown up and so had my girl and as i was known to be in weak health it seemed a fine stroke to him that his lad should step into the whole property but there i was firm i would not have his cursed stock mixed with mine not that i had any dislike to the lad but his blood was in him and that was enough i stood firm mccarthy threatened i braved him to do his worst we were to meet at the pool midway between our houses to talk it over when i went down there i found him talking with his son so i smoked a cigar and waited behind a tree until he should be alone but as i listened to his talk all that was black and bitter in me seemed to come uppermost he was urging his son to marry my daughter with as little regard for what she might think as if she were a slut from off the streets it drove me mad to think that i and all that i held most dear should be in the power of such a man as this could i not snap the bond i was already a dying and a desperate man though clear of mind and fairly strong of limb i knew that my own fate was sealed but my memory and my girl both could be saved if i could but silence that foul tongue i did it mr holmes i would do it again deeply as i have sinned i have led a life of martyrdom to atone for it but that my girl should be entangled in the same meshes which held me was more than i could suffer i struck him down with no more compunction than if he had been some foul and venomous beast his cry brought back his son but i had gained the cover of the wood though i was forced to go back to fetch the cloak which i had dropped in my flight that is the true story gentlemen of all that occurred well it is not for me to judge you said holmes as the old man signed the statement which had been drawn out i pray that we may never be exposed to such a temptation i pray not sir and what do you intend to do in view of your health nothing you are yourself aware that you will soon have to answer for your deed at a higher court than the assizes i will keep your confession and if mccarthy is condemned i shall be forced to use it if not it shall never be seen by mortal eye and your secret whether you be alive or dead shall be safe with us farewell then said the old man solemnly your own deathbeds when they come will be the easier for the thought of the peace which you have given to mine tottering and shaking in all his giant frame he stumbled slowly from the room god help us said holmes after a long silence why does fate play such tricks with poor helpless worms i never hear of such a case as this that i do not think of baxter s words and say there but for the grace of god goes sherlock holmes james mccarthy was acquitted at the assizes on the strength of a number of objections which had been drawn out by holmes and submitted to the defending counsel old turner lived for seven months after our interview but he is now dead and there is every prospect that the son and daughter may come to live happily together in ignorance of the black cloud which rests upon their past v the five orange pips when i glance over my notes and records of the sherlock holmes cases between the years and i am faced by so many which present strange and interesting features that it is no easy matter to know which to choose and which to leave some however have already gained publicity through the papers and others have not offered a field for those peculiar qualities which my friend possessed in so high a degree and which it is the object of these papers to illustrate some too have baffled his analytical skill and would be as narratives beginnings without an ending while others have been but partially cleared up and have their explanations founded rather upon conjecture and surmise than on that absolute logical proof which was so dear to him there is however one of these last which was so remarkable in its details and so startling in its results that i am tempted to give some account of it in spite of the fact that there are points in connection with it which never have been and probably never will be entirely cleared up the year furnished us with a long series of cases of greater or less interest of which i retain the records among my headings under this one twelve months i find an account of the adventure of the paradol chamber of the amateur mendicant society who held a luxurious club in the lower vault of a furniture warehouse of the facts connected with the loss of the british barque sophy anderson of the singular adventures of the grice patersons in the island of uffa and finally of the camberwell poisoning case in the latter as may be remembered sherlock holmes was able by winding up the dead man s watch to prove that it had been wound up two hours before and that therefore the deceased had gone to bed within that time a deduction which was of the greatest importance in clearing up the case all these i may sketch out at some future date but none of them present such singular features as the strange train of circumstances which i have now taken up my pen to describe it was in the latter days of september and the equinoctial gales had set in with exceptional violence all day the wind had screamed and the rain had beaten against the windows so that even here in the heart of great hand made london we were forced to raise our minds for the instant from the routine of life and to recognise the presence of those great elemental forces which shriek at mankind through the bars of his civilisation like untamed beasts in a cage as evening drew in the storm grew higher and louder and the wind cried and sobbed like a child in the chimney sherlock holmes sat moodily at one side of the fireplace cross indexing his records of crime while i at the other was deep in one of clark russell s fine sea stories until the howl of the gale from without seemed to blend with the text and the splash of the rain to lengthen out into the long swash of the sea waves my wife was on a visit to her mother s and for a few days i was a dweller once more in my old quarters at baker street why said i glancing up at my companion that was surely the bell who could come to night some friend of yours perhaps except yourself i have none he answered i do not encourage visitors a client then if so it is a serious case nothing less would bring a man out on such a day and at such an hour but i take it that it is more likely to be some crony of the landlady s sherlock holmes was wrong in his conjecture however for there came a step in the passage and a tapping at the door he stretched out his long arm to turn the lamp away from himself and towards the vacant chair upon which a newcomer must sit come in said he the man who entered was young some two and twenty at the outside well groomed and trimly clad with something of refinement and delicacy in his bearing the streaming umbrella which he held in his hand and his long shining waterproof told of the fierce weather through which he had come he looked about him anxiously in the glare of the lamp and i could see that his face was pale and his eyes heavy like those of a man who is weighed down with some great anxiety i owe you an apology he said raising his golden pince nez to his eyes i trust that i am not intruding i fear that i have brought some traces of the storm and rain into your snug chamber give me your coat and umbrella said holmes they may rest here on the hook and will be dry presently you have come up from the south west i see yes from horsham that clay and chalk mixture which i see upon your toe caps is quite distinctive i have come for advice that is easily got and help that is not always so easy i have heard of you mr holmes i heard from major prendergast how you saved him in the tankerville club scandal ah of course he was wrongfully accused of cheating at cards he said that you could solve anything he said too much that you are never beaten i have been beaten four times three times by men and once by a woman but what is that compared with the number of your successes it is true that i have been generally successful then you may be so with me i beg that you will draw your chair up to the fire and favour me with some details as to your case it is no ordinary one none of those which come to me are i am the last court of appeal and yet i question sir whether in all your experience you have ever listened to a more mysterious and inexplicable chain of events than those which have happened in my own family you fill me with interest said holmes pray give us the essential facts from the commencement and i can afterwards question you as to those details which seem to me to be most important the young man pulled his chair up and pushed his wet feet out towards the blaze my name said he is john openshaw but my own affairs have as far as i can understand little to do with this awful business it is a hereditary matter so in order to give you an idea of the facts i must go back to the commencement of the affair you must know that my grandfather had two sons my uncle elias and my father joseph my father had a small factory at coventry which he enlarged at the time of the invention of bicycling he was a patentee of the openshaw unbreakable tire and his business met with such success that he was able to sell it and to retire upon a handsome competence my uncle elias emigrated to america when he was a young man and became a planter in florida where he was reported to have done very well at the time of the war he fought in jackson s army and afterwards under hood where he rose to be a colonel when lee laid down his arms my uncle returned to his plantation where he remained for three or four years about or he came back to europe and took a small estate in sussex near horsham he had made a very considerable fortune in the states and his reason for leaving them was his aversion to the negroes and his dislike of the republican policy in extending the franchise to them he was a singular man fierce and quick tempered very foul mouthed when he was angry and of a most retiring disposition during all the years that he lived at horsham i doubt if ever he set foot in the town he had a garden and two or three fields round his house and there he would take his exercise though very often for weeks on end he would never leave his room he drank a great deal of brandy and smoked very heavily but he would see no society and did not want any friends not even his own brother he didn t mind me in fact he took a fancy to me for at the time when he saw me first i was a youngster of twelve or so this would be in the year after he had been eight or nine years in england he begged my father to let me live with him and he was very kind to me in his way when he was sober he used to be fond of playing backgammon and draughts with me and he would make me his representative both with the servants and with the tradespeople so that by the time that i was sixteen i was quite master of the house i kept all the keys and could go where i liked and do what i liked so long as i did not disturb him in his privacy there was one singular exception however for he had a single room a lumber room up among the attics which was invariably locked and which he would never permit either me or anyone else to enter with a boy s curiosity i have peeped through the keyhole but i was never able to see more than such a collection of old trunks and bundles as would be expected in such a room one day it was in march a letter with a foreign stamp lay upon the table in front of the colonel s plate it was not a common thing for him to receive letters for his bills were all paid in ready money and he had no friends of any sort from india said he as he took it up pondicherry postmark what can this be opening it hurriedly out there jumped five little dried orange pips which pattered down upon his plate i began to laugh at this but the laugh was struck from my lips at the sight of his face his lip had fallen his eyes were protruding his skin the colour of putty and he glared at the envelope which he still held in his trembling hand k k k he shrieked and then my god my god my sins have overtaken me what is it uncle i cried death said he and rising from the table he retired to his room leaving me palpitating with horror i took up the envelope and saw scrawled in red ink upon the inner flap just above the gum the letter k three times repeated there was nothing else save the five dried pips what could be the reason of his overpowering terror i left the breakfast table and as i ascended the stair i met him coming down with an old rusty key which must have belonged to the attic in one hand and a small brass box like a cashbox in the other they may do what they like but i ll checkmate them still said he with an oath tell mary that i shall want a fire in my room to day and send down to fordham the horsham lawyer i did as he ordered and when the lawyer arrived i was asked to step up to the room the fire was burning brightly and in the grate there was a mass of black fluffy ashes as of burned paper while the brass box stood open and empty beside it as i glanced at the box i noticed with a start that upon the lid was printed the treble k which i had read in the morning upon the envelope i wish you john said my uncle to witness my will i leave my estate with all its advantages and all its disadvantages to my brother your father whence it will no doubt descend to you if you can enjoy it in peace well and good if you find you cannot take my advice my boy and leave it to your deadliest enemy i am sorry to give you such a two edged thing but i can t say what turn things are going to take kindly sign the paper where mr fordham shows you i signed the paper as directed and the lawyer took it away with him the singular incident made as you may think the deepest impression upon me and i pondered over it and turned it every way in my mind without being able to make anything of it yet i could not shake off the vague feeling of dread which it left behind though the sensation grew less keen as the weeks passed and nothing happened to disturb the usual routine of our lives i could see a change in my uncle however he drank more than ever and he was less inclined for any sort of society most of his time he would spend in his room with the door locked upon the inside but sometimes he would emerge in a sort of drunken frenzy and would burst out of the house and tear about the garden with a revolver in his hand screaming out that he was afraid of no man and that he was not to be cooped up like a sheep in a pen by man or devil when these hot fits were over however he would rush tumultuously in at the door and lock and bar it behind him like a man who can brazen it out no longer against the terror which lies at the roots of his soul at such times i have seen his face even on a cold day glisten with moisture as though it were new raised from a basin well to come to an end of the matter mr holmes and not to abuse your patience there came a night when he made one of those drunken sallies from which he never came back we found him when we went to search for him face downward in a little green scummed pool which lay at the foot of the garden there was no sign of any violence and the water was but two feet deep so that the jury having regard to his known eccentricity brought in a verdict of suicide but i who knew how he winced from the very thought of death had much ado to persuade myself that he had gone out of his way to meet it the matter passed however and my father entered into possession of the estate and of some which lay to his credit at the bank one moment holmes interposed your statement is i foresee one of the most remarkable to which i have ever listened let me have the date of the reception by your uncle of the letter and the date of his supposed suicide the letter arrived on march his death was seven weeks later upon the night of may nd thank you pray proceed when my father took over the horsham property he at my request made a careful examination of the attic which had been always locked up we found the brass box there although its contents had been destroyed on the inside of the cover was a paper label with the initials of k k k repeated upon it and letters memoranda receipts and a register written beneath these we presume indicated the nature of the papers which had been destroyed by colonel openshaw for the rest there was nothing of much importance in the attic save a great many scattered papers and note books bearing upon my uncle s life in america some of them were of the war time and showed that he had done his duty well and had borne the repute of a brave soldier others were of a date during the reconstruction of the southern states and were mostly concerned with politics for he had evidently taken a strong part in opposing the carpet bag politicians who had been sent down from the north well it was the beginning of when my father came to live at horsham and all went as well as possible with us until the january of on the fourth day after the new year i heard my father give a sharp cry of surprise as we sat together at the breakfast table there he was sitting with a newly opened envelope in one hand and five dried orange pips in the outstretched palm of the other one he had always laughed at what he called my cock and bull story about the colonel but he looked very scared and puzzled now that the same thing had come upon himself why what on earth does this mean john he stammered my heart had turned to lead it is k k k said i he looked inside the envelope so it is he cried here are the very letters but what is this written above them put the papers on the sundial i read peeping over his shoulder what papers what sundial he asked the sundial in the garden there is no other said i but the papers must be those that are destroyed pooh said he gripping hard at his courage we are in a civilised land here and we can t have tomfoolery of this kind where does the thing come from from dundee i answered glancing at the postmark some preposterous practical joke said he what have i to do with sundials and papers i shall take no notice of such nonsense i should certainly speak to the police i said and be laughed at for my pains nothing of the sort then let me do so no i forbid you i won t have a fuss made about such nonsense it was in vain to argue with him for he was a very obstinate man i went about however with a heart which was full of forebodings on the third day after the coming of the letter my father went from home to visit an old friend of his major freebody who is in command of one of the forts upon portsdown hill i was glad that he should go for it seemed to me that he was farther from danger when he was away from home in that however i was in error upon the second day of his absence i received a telegram from the major imploring me to come at once my father had fallen over one of the deep chalk pits which abound in the neighbourhood and was lying senseless with a shattered skull i hurried to him but he passed away without having ever recovered his consciousness he had as it appears been returning from fareham in the twilight and as the country was unknown to him and the chalk pit unfenced the jury had no hesitation in bringing in a verdict of death from accidental causes carefully as i examined every fact connected with his death i was unable to find anything which could suggest the idea of murder there were no signs of violence no footmarks no robbery no record of strangers having been seen upon the roads and yet i need not tell you that my mind was far from at ease and that i was well nigh certain that some foul plot had been woven round him in this sinister way i came into my inheritance you will ask me why i did not dispose of it i answer because i was well convinced that our troubles were in some way dependent upon an incident in my uncle s life and that the danger would be as pressing in one house as in another it was in january that my poor father met his end and two years and eight months have elapsed since then during that time i have lived happily at horsham and i had begun to hope that this curse had passed away from the family and that it had ended with the last generation i had begun to take comfort too soon however yesterday morning the blow fell in the very shape in which it had come upon my father the young man took from his waistcoat a crumpled envelope and turning to the table he shook out upon it five little dried orange pips this is the envelope he continued the postmark is london eastern division within are the very words which were upon my father s last message k k k and then put the papers on the sundial what have you done asked holmes nothing nothing to tell the truth he sank his face into his thin white hands i have felt helpless i have felt like one of those poor rabbits when the snake is writhing towards it i seem to be in the grasp of some resistless inexorable evil which no foresight and no precautions can guard against tut tut cried sherlock holmes you must act man or you are lost nothing but energy can save you this is no time for despair i have seen the police ah but they listened to my story with a smile i am convinced that the inspector has formed the opinion that the letters are all practical jokes and that the deaths of my relations were really accidents as the jury stated and were not to be connected with the warnings holmes shook his clenched hands in the air incredible imbecility he cried they have however allowed me a policeman who may remain in the house with me has he come with you to night no his orders were to stay in the house again holmes raved in the air why did you come to me he said and above all why did you not come at once i did not know it was only to day that i spoke to major prendergast about my troubles and was advised by him to come to you it is really two days since you had the letter we should have acted before this you have no further evidence i suppose than that which you have placed before us no suggestive detail which might help us there is one thing said john openshaw he rummaged in his coat pocket and drawing out a piece of discoloured blue tinted paper he laid it out upon the table i have some remembrance said he that on the day when my uncle burned the papers i observed that the small unburned margins which lay amid the ashes were of this particular colour i found this single sheet upon the floor of his room and i am inclined to think that it may be one of the papers which has perhaps fluttered out from among the others and in that way has escaped destruction beyond the mention of pips i do not see that it helps us much i think myself that it is a page from some private diary the writing is undoubtedly my uncle s holmes moved the lamp and we both bent over the sheet of paper which showed by its ragged edge that it had indeed been torn from a book it was headed march and beneath were the following enigmatical notices th hudson came same old platform th set the pips on mccauley paramore and john swain of st augustine th mccauley cleared th john swain cleared th visited paramore all well thank you said holmes folding up the paper and returning it to our visitor and now you must on no account lose another instant we cannot spare time even to discuss what you have told me you must get home instantly and act what shall i do there is but one thing to do it must be done at once you must put this piece of paper which you have shown us into the brass box which you have described you must also put in a note to say that all the other papers were burned by your uncle and that this is the only one which remains you must assert that in such words as will carry conviction with them having done this you must at once put the box out upon the sundial as directed do you understand entirely do not think of revenge or anything of the sort at present i think that we may gain that by means of the law but we have our web to weave while theirs is already woven the first consideration is to remove the pressing danger which threatens you the second is to clear up the mystery and to punish the guilty parties i thank you said the young man rising and pulling on his overcoat you have given me fresh life and hope i shall certainly do as you advise do not lose an instant and above all take care of yourself in the meanwhile for i do not think that there can be a doubt that you are threatened by a very real and imminent danger how do you go back by train from waterloo it is not yet nine the streets will be crowded so i trust that you may be in safety and yet you cannot guard yourself too closely i am armed that is well to morrow i shall set to work upon your case i shall see you at horsham then no your secret lies in london it is there that i shall seek it then i shall call upon you in a day or in two days with news as to the box and the papers i shall take your advice in every particular he shook hands with us and took his leave outside the wind still screamed and the rain splashed and pattered against the windows this strange wild story seemed to have come to us from amid the mad elements blown in upon us like a sheet of sea weed in a gale and now to have been reabsorbed by them once more sherlock holmes sat for some time in silence with his head sunk forward and his eyes bent upon the red glow of the fire then he lit his pipe and leaning back in his chair he watched the blue smoke rings as they chased each other up to the ceiling i think watson he remarked at last that of all our cases we have had none more fantastic than this save perhaps the sign of four well yes save perhaps that and yet this john openshaw seems to me to be walking amid even greater perils than did the sholtos but have you i asked formed any definite conception as to what these perils are there can be no question as to their nature he answered then what are they who is this k k k and why does he pursue this unhappy family sherlock holmes closed his eyes and placed his elbows upon the arms of his chair with his finger tips together the ideal reasoner he remarked would when he had once been shown a single fact in all its bearings deduce from it not only all the chain of events which led up to it but also all the results which would follow from it as cuvier could correctly describe a whole animal by the contemplation of a single bone so the observer who has thoroughly understood one link in a series of incidents should be able to accurately state all the other ones both before and after we have not yet grasped the results which the reason alone can attain to problems may be solved in the study which have baffled all those who have sought a solution by the aid of their senses to carry the art however to its highest pitch it is necessary that the reasoner should be able to utilise all the facts which have come to his knowledge and this in itself implies as you will readily see a possession of all knowledge which even in these days of free education and encyclop dias is a somewhat rare accomplishment it is not so impossible however that a man should possess all knowledge which is likely to be useful to him in his work and this i have endeavoured in my case to do if i remember rightly you on one occasion in the early days of our friendship defined my limits in a very precise fashion yes i answered laughing it was a singular document philosophy astronomy and politics were marked at zero i remember botany variable geology profound as regards the mud stains from any region within fifty miles of town chemistry eccentric anatomy unsystematic sensational literature and crime records unique violin player boxer swordsman lawyer and self poisoner by cocaine and tobacco those i think were the main points of my analysis holmes grinned at the last item well he said i say now as i said then that a man should keep his little brain attic stocked with all the furniture that he is likely to use and the rest he can put away in the lumber room of his library where he can get it if he wants it now for such a case as the one which has been submitted to us to night we need certainly to muster all our resources kindly hand me down the letter k of the american encyclop dia which stands upon the shelf beside you thank you now let us consider the situation and see what may be deduced from it in the first place we may start with a strong presumption that colonel openshaw had some very strong reason for leaving america men at his time of life do not change all their habits and exchange willingly the charming climate of florida for the lonely life of an english provincial town his extreme love of solitude in england suggests the idea that he was in fear of someone or something so we may assume as a working hypothesis that it was fear of someone or something which drove him from america as to what it was he feared we can only deduce that by considering the formidable letters which were received by himself and his successors did you remark the postmarks of those letters the first was from pondicherry the second from dundee and the third from london from east london what do you deduce from that they are all seaports that the writer was on board of a ship excellent we have already a clue there can be no doubt that the probability the strong probability is that the writer was on board of a ship and now let us consider another point in the case of pondicherry seven weeks elapsed between the threat and its fulfilment in dundee it was only some three or four days does that suggest anything a greater distance to travel but the letter had also a greater distance to come then i do not see the point there is at least a presumption that the vessel in which the man or men are is a sailing ship it looks as if they always send their singular warning or token before them when starting upon their mission you see how quickly the deed followed the sign when it came from dundee if they had come from pondicherry in a steamer they would have arrived almost as soon as their letter but as a matter of fact seven weeks elapsed i think that those seven weeks represented the difference between the mail boat which brought the letter and the sailing vessel which brought the writer it is possible more than that it is probable and now you see the deadly urgency of this new case and why i urged young openshaw to caution the blow has always fallen at the end of the time which it would take the senders to travel the distance but this one comes from london and therefore we cannot count upon delay good god i cried what can it mean this relentless persecution the papers which openshaw carried are obviously of vital importance to the person or persons in the sailing ship i think that it is quite clear that there must be more than one of them a single man could not have carried out two deaths in such a way as to deceive a coroner s jury there must have been several in it and they must have been men of resource and determination their papers they mean to have be the holder of them who it may in this way you see k k k ceases to be the initials of an individual and becomes the badge of a society but of what society have you never said sherlock holmes bending forward and sinking his voice have you never heard of the ku klux klan i never have holmes turned over the leaves of the book upon his knee here it is said he presently ku klux klan a name derived from the fanciful resemblance to the sound produced by cocking a rifle this terrible secret society was formed by some ex confederate soldiers in the southern states after the civil war and it rapidly formed local branches in different parts of the country notably in tennessee louisiana the carolinas georgia and florida its power was used for political purposes principally for the terrorising of the negro voters and the murdering and driving from the country of those who were opposed to its views its outrages were usually preceded by a warning sent to the marked man in some fantastic but generally recognised shape a sprig of oak leaves in some parts melon seeds or orange pips in others on receiving this the victim might either openly abjure his former ways or might fly from the country if he braved the matter out death would unfailingly come upon him and usually in some strange and unforeseen manner so perfect was the organisation of the society and so systematic its methods that there is hardly a case upon record where any man succeeded in braving it with impunity or in which any of its outrages were traced home to the perpetrators for some years the organisation flourished in spite of the efforts of the united states government and of the better classes of the community in the south eventually in the year the movement rather suddenly collapsed although there have been sporadic outbreaks of the same sort since that date you will observe said holmes laying down the volume that the sudden breaking up of the society was coincident with the disappearance of openshaw from america with their papers it may well have been cause and effect it is no wonder that he and his family have some of the more implacable spirits upon their track you can understand that this register and diary may implicate some of the first men in the south and that there may be many who will not sleep easy at night until it is recovered then the page we have seen is such as we might expect it ran if i remember right sent the pips to a b and c that is sent the society s warning to them then there are successive entries that a and b cleared or left the country and finally that c was visited with i fear a sinister result for c well i think doctor that we may let some light into this dark place and i believe that the only chance young openshaw has in the meantime is to do what i have told him there is nothing more to be said or to be done to night so hand me over my violin and let us try to forget for half an hour the miserable weather and the still more miserable ways of our fellow men it had cleared in the morning and the sun was shining with a subdued brightness through the dim veil which hangs over the great city sherlock holmes was already at breakfast when i came down you will excuse me for not waiting for you said he i have i foresee a very busy day before me in looking into this case of young openshaw s what steps will you take i asked it will very much depend upon the results of my first inquiries i may have to go down to horsham after all you will not go there first no i shall commence with the city just ring the bell and the maid will bring up your coffee as i waited i lifted the unopened newspaper from the table and glanced my eye over it it rested upon a heading which sent a chill to my heart holmes i cried you are too late ah said he laying down his cup i feared as much how was it done he spoke calmly but i could see that he was deeply moved my eye caught the name of openshaw and the heading tragedy near waterloo bridge here is the account between nine and ten last night police constable cook of the h division on duty near waterloo bridge heard a cry for help and a splash in the water the night however was extremely dark and stormy so that in spite of the help of several passers by it was quite impossible to effect a rescue the alarm however was given and by the aid of the water police the body was eventually recovered it proved to be that of a young gentleman whose name as it appears from an envelope which was found in his pocket was john openshaw and whose residence is near horsham it is conjectured that he may have been hurrying down to catch the last train from waterloo station and that in his haste and the extreme darkness he missed his path and walked over the edge of one of the small landing places for river steamboats the body exhibited no traces of violence and there can be no doubt that the deceased had been the victim of an unfortunate accident which should have the effect of calling the attention of the authorities to the condition of the riverside landing stages we sat in silence for some minutes holmes more depressed and shaken than i had ever seen him that hurts my pride watson he said at last it is a petty feeling no doubt but it hurts my pride it becomes a personal matter with me now and if god sends me health i shall set my hand upon this gang that he should come to me for help and that i should send him away to his death he sprang from his chair and paced about the room in uncontrollable agitation with a flush upon his sallow cheeks and a nervous clasping and unclasping of his long thin hands they must be cunning devils he exclaimed at last how could they have decoyed him down there the embankment is not on the direct line to the station the bridge no doubt was too crowded even on such a night for their purpose well watson we shall see who will win in the long run i am going out now to the police no i shall be my own police when i have spun the web they may take the flies but not before all day i was engaged in my professional work and it was late in the evening before i returned to baker street sherlock holmes had not come back yet it was nearly ten o clock before he entered looking pale and worn he walked up to the sideboard and tearing a piece from the loaf he devoured it voraciously washing it down with a long draught of water you are hungry i remarked starving it had escaped my memory i have had nothing since breakfast nothing not a bite i had no time to think of it and how have you succeeded well you have a clue i have them in the hollow of my hand young openshaw shall not long remain unavenged why watson let us put their own devilish trade mark upon them it is well thought of what do you mean he took an orange from the cupboard and tearing it to pieces he squeezed out the pips upon the table of these he took five and thrust them into an envelope on the inside of the flap he wrote s h for j o then he sealed it and addressed it to captain james calhoun barque lone star savannah georgia that will await him when he enters port said he chuckling it may give him a sleepless night he will find it as sure a precursor of his fate as openshaw did before him and who is this captain calhoun the leader of the gang i shall have the others but he first how did you trace it then he took a large sheet of paper from his pocket all covered with dates and names i have spent the whole day said he over lloyd s registers and files of the old papers following the future career of every vessel which touched at pondicherry in january and february in there were thirty six ships of fair tonnage which were reported there during those months of these one the lone star instantly attracted my attention since although it was reported as having cleared from london the name is that which is given to one of the states of the union texas i think i was not and am not sure which but i knew that the ship must have an american origin what then i searched the dundee records and when i found that the barque lone star was there in january my suspicion became a certainty i then inquired as to the vessels which lay at present in the port of london yes the lone star had arrived here last week i went down to the albert dock and found that she had been taken down the river by the early tide this morning homeward bound to savannah i wired to gravesend and learned that she had passed some time ago and as the wind is easterly i have no doubt that she is now past the goodwins and not very far from the isle of wight what will you do then oh i have my hand upon him he and the two mates are as i learn the only native born americans in the ship the others are finns and germans i know also that they were all three away from the ship last night i had it from the stevedore who has been loading their cargo by the time that their sailing ship reaches savannah the mail boat will have carried this letter and the cable will have informed the police of savannah that these three gentlemen are badly wanted here upon a charge of murder there is ever a flaw however in the best laid of human plans and the murderers of john openshaw were never to receive the orange pips which would show them that another as cunning and as resolute as themselves was upon their track very long and very severe were the equinoctial gales that year we waited long for news of the lone star of savannah but none ever reached us we did at last hear that somewhere far out in the atlantic a shattered stern post of a boat was seen swinging in the trough of a wave with the letters l s carved upon it and that is all which we shall ever know of the fate of the lone star vi the man with the twisted lip isa whitney brother of the late elias whitney d d principal of the theological college of st george s was much addicted to opium the habit grew upon him as i understand from some foolish freak when he was at college for having read de quincey s description of his dreams and sensations he had drenched his tobacco with laudanum in an attempt to produce the same effects he found as so many more have done that the practice is easier to attain than to get rid of and for many years he continued to be a slave to the drug an object of mingled horror and pity to his friends and relatives i can see him now with yellow pasty face drooping lids and pin point pupils all huddled in a chair the wreck and ruin of a noble man one night it was in june there came a ring to my bell about the hour when a man gives his first yawn and glances at the clock i sat up in my chair and my wife laid her needle work down in her lap and made a little face of disappointment a patient said she you ll have to go out i groaned for i was newly come back from a weary day we heard the door open a few hurried words and then quick steps upon the linoleum our own door flew open and a lady clad in some dark coloured stuff with a black veil entered the room you will excuse my calling so late she began and then suddenly losing her self control she ran forward threw her arms about my wife s neck and sobbed upon her shoulder oh i m in such trouble she cried i do so want a little help why said my wife pulling up her veil it is kate whitney how you startled me kate i had not an idea who you were when you came in i didn t know what to do so i came straight to you that was always the way folk who were in grief came to my wife like birds to a lighthouse it was very sweet of you to come now you must have some wine and water and sit here comfortably and tell us all about it or should you rather that i sent james off to bed oh no no i want the doctor s advice and help too it s about isa he has not been home for two days i am so frightened about him it was not the first time that she had spoken to us of her husband s trouble to me as a doctor to my wife as an old friend and school companion we soothed and comforted her by such words as we could find did she know where her husband was was it possible that we could bring him back to her it seems that it was she had the surest information that of late he had when the fit was on him made use of an opium den in the farthest east of the city hitherto his orgies had always been confined to one day and he had come back twitching and shattered in the evening but now the spell had been upon him eight and forty hours and he lay there doubtless among the dregs of the docks breathing in the poison or sleeping off the effects there he was to be found she was sure of it at the bar of gold in upper swandam lane but what was she to do how could she a young and timid woman make her way into such a place and pluck her husband out from among the ruffians who surrounded him there was the case and of course there was but one way out of it might i not escort her to this place and then as a second thought why should she come at all i was isa whitney s medical adviser and as such i had influence over him i could manage it better if i were alone i promised her on my word that i would send him home in a cab within two hours if he were indeed at the address which she had given me and so in ten minutes i had left my armchair and cheery sitting room behind me and was speeding eastward in a hansom on a strange errand as it seemed to me at the time though the future only could show how strange it was to be but there was no great difficulty in the first stage of my adventure upper swandam lane is a vile alley lurking behind the high wharves which line the north side of the river to the east of london bridge between a slop shop and a gin shop approached by a steep flight of steps leading down to a black gap like the mouth of a cave i found the den of which i was in search ordering my cab to wait i passed down the steps worn hollow in the centre by the ceaseless tread of drunken feet and by the light of a flickering oil lamp above the door i found the latch and made my way into a long low room thick and heavy with the brown opium smoke and terraced with wooden berths like the forecastle of an emigrant ship through the gloom one could dimly catch a glimpse of bodies lying in strange fantastic poses bowed shoulders bent knees heads thrown back and chins pointing upward with here and there a dark lack lustre eye turned upon the newcomer out of the black shadows there glimmered little red circles of light now bright now faint as the burning poison waxed or waned in the bowls of the metal pipes the most lay silent but some muttered to themselves and others talked together in a strange low monotonous voice their conversation coming in gushes and then suddenly tailing off into silence each mumbling out his own thoughts and paying little heed to the words of his neighbour at the farther end was a small brazier of burning charcoal beside which on a three legged wooden stool there sat a tall thin old man with his jaw resting upon his two fists and his elbows upon his knees staring into the fire as i entered a sallow malay attendant had hurried up with a pipe for me and a supply of the drug beckoning me to an empty berth thank you i have not come to stay said i there is a friend of mine here mr isa whitney and i wish to speak with him there was a movement and an exclamation from my right and peering through the gloom i saw whitney pale haggard and unkempt staring out at me my god it s watson said he he was in a pitiable state of reaction with every nerve in a twitter i say watson what o clock is it nearly eleven of what day of friday june th good heavens i thought it was wednesday it is wednesday what d you want to frighten a chap for he sank his face onto his arms and began to sob in a high treble key i tell you that it is friday man your wife has been waiting this two days for you you should be ashamed of yourself so i am but you ve got mixed watson for i have only been here a few hours three pipes four pipes i forget how many but i ll go home with you i wouldn t frighten kate poor little kate give me your hand have you a cab yes i have one waiting then i shall go in it but i must owe something find what i owe watson i am all off colour i can do nothing for myself i walked down the narrow passage between the double row of sleepers holding my breath to keep out the vile stupefying fumes of the drug and looking about for the manager as i passed the tall man who sat by the brazier i felt a sudden pluck at my skirt and a low voice whispered walk past me and then look back at me the words fell quite distinctly upon my ear i glanced down they could only have come from the old man at my side and yet he sat now as absorbed as ever very thin very wrinkled bent with age an opium pipe dangling down from between his knees as though it had dropped in sheer lassitude from his fingers i took two steps forward and looked back it took all my self control to prevent me from breaking out into a cry of astonishment he had turned his back so that none could see him but i his form had filled out his wrinkles were gone the dull eyes had regained their fire and there sitting by the fire and grinning at my surprise was none other than sherlock holmes he made a slight motion to me to approach him and instantly as he turned his face half round to the company once more subsided into a doddering loose lipped senility holmes i whispered what on earth are you doing in this den as low as you can he answered i have excellent ears if you would have the great kindness to get rid of that sottish friend of yours i should be exceedingly glad to have a little talk with you i have a cab outside then pray send him home in it you may safely trust him for he appears to be too limp to get into any mischief i should recommend you also to send a note by the cabman to your wife to say that you have thrown in your lot with me if you will wait outside i shall be with you in five minutes it was difficult to refuse any of sherlock holmes requests for they were always so exceedingly definite and put forward with such a quiet air of mastery i felt however that when whitney was once confined in the cab my mission was practically accomplished and for the rest i could not wish anything better than to be associated with my friend in one of those singular adventures which were the normal condition of his existence in a few minutes i had written my note paid whitney s bill led him out to the cab and seen him driven through the darkness in a very short time a decrepit figure had emerged from the opium den and i was walking down the street with sherlock holmes for two streets he shuffled along with a bent back and an uncertain foot then glancing quickly round he straightened himself out and burst into a hearty fit of laughter i suppose watson said he that you imagine that i have added opium smoking to cocaine injections and all the other little weaknesses on which you have favoured me with your medical views i was certainly surprised to find you there but not more so than i to find you i came to find a friend and i to find an enemy an enemy yes one of my natural enemies or shall i say my natural prey briefly watson i am in the midst of a very remarkable inquiry and i have hoped to find a clue in the incoherent ramblings of these sots as i have done before now had i been recognised in that den my life would not have been worth an hour s purchase for i have used it before now for my own purposes and the rascally lascar who runs it has sworn to have vengeance upon me there is a trap door at the back of that building near the corner of paul s wharf which could tell some strange tales of what has passed through it upon the moonless nights what you do not mean bodies ay bodies watson we should be rich men if we had for every poor devil who has been done to death in that den it is the vilest murder trap on the whole riverside and i fear that neville st clair has entered it never to leave it more but our trap should be here he put his two forefingers between his teeth and whistled shrilly a signal which was answered by a similar whistle from the distance followed shortly by the rattle of wheels and the clink of horses hoofs now watson said holmes as a tall dog cart dashed up through the gloom throwing out two golden tunnels of yellow light from its side lanterns you ll come with me won t you if i can be of use oh a trusty comrade is always of use and a chronicler still more so my room at the cedars is a double bedded one the cedars yes that is mr st clair s house i am staying there while i conduct the inquiry where is it then near lee in kent we have a seven mile drive before us but i am all in the dark of course you are you ll know all about it presently jump up here all right john we shall not need you here s half a crown look out for me to morrow about eleven give her her head so long then he flicked the horse with his whip and we dashed away through the endless succession of sombre and deserted streets which widened gradually until we were flying across a broad balustraded bridge with the murky river flowing sluggishly beneath us beyond lay another dull wilderness of bricks and mortar its silence broken only by the heavy regular footfall of the policeman or the songs and shouts of some belated party of revellers a dull wrack was drifting slowly across the sky and a star or two twinkled dimly here and there through the rifts of the clouds holmes drove in silence with his head sunk upon his breast and the air of a man who is lost in thought while i sat beside him curious to learn what this new quest might be which seemed to tax his powers so sorely and yet afraid to break in upon the current of his thoughts we had driven several miles and were beginning to get to the fringe of the belt of suburban villas when he shook himself shrugged his shoulders and lit up his pipe with the air of a man who has satisfied himself that he is acting for the best you have a grand gift of silence watson said he it makes you quite invaluable as a companion pon my word it is a great thing for me to have someone to talk to for my own thoughts are not over pleasant i was wondering what i should say to this dear little woman to night when she meets me at the door you forget that i know nothing about it i shall just have time to tell you the facts of the case before we get to lee it seems absurdly simple and yet somehow i can get nothing to go upon there s plenty of thread no doubt but i can t get the end of it into my hand now i ll state the case clearly and concisely to you watson and maybe you can see a spark where all is dark to me proceed then some years ago to be definite in may there came to lee a gentleman neville st clair by name who appeared to have plenty of money he took a large villa laid out the grounds very nicely and lived generally in good style by degrees he made friends in the neighbourhood and in he married the daughter of a local brewer by whom he now has two children he had no occupation but was interested in several companies and went into town as a rule in the morning returning by the from cannon street every night mr st clair is now thirty seven years of age is a man of temperate habits a good husband a very affectionate father and a man who is popular with all who know him i may add that his whole debts at the present moment as far as we have been able to ascertain amount to s while he has standing to his credit in the capital and counties bank there is no reason therefore to think that money troubles have been weighing upon his mind last monday mr neville st clair went into town rather earlier than usual remarking before he started that he had two important commissions to perform and that he would bring his little boy home a box of bricks now by the merest chance his wife received a telegram upon this same monday very shortly after his departure to the effect that a small parcel of considerable value which she had been expecting was waiting for her at the offices of the aberdeen shipping company now if you are well up in your london you will know that the office of the company is in fresno street which branches out of upper swandam lane where you found me to night mrs st clair had her lunch started for the city did some shopping proceeded to the company s office got her packet and found herself at exactly walking through swandam lane on her way back to the station have you followed me so far it is very clear if you remember monday was an exceedingly hot day and mrs st clair walked slowly glancing about in the hope of seeing a cab as she did not like the neighbourhood in which she found herself while she was walking in this way down swandam lane she suddenly heard an ejaculation or cry and was struck cold to see her husband looking down at her and as it seemed to her beckoning to her from a second floor window the window was open and she distinctly saw his face which she describes as being terribly agitated he waved his hands frantically to her and then vanished from the window so suddenly that it seemed to her that he had been plucked back by some irresistible force from behind one singular point which struck her quick feminine eye was that although he wore some dark coat such as he had started to town in he had on neither collar nor necktie convinced that something was amiss with him she rushed down the steps for the house was none other than the opium den in which you found me to night and running through the front room she attempted to ascend the stairs which led to the first floor at the foot of the stairs however she met this lascar scoundrel of whom i have spoken who thrust her back and aided by a dane who acts as assistant there pushed her out into the street filled with the most maddening doubts and fears she rushed down the lane and by rare good fortune met in fresno street a number of constables with an inspector all on their way to their beat the inspector and two men accompanied her back and in spite of the continued resistance of the proprietor they made their way to the room in which mr st clair had last been seen there was no sign of him there in fact in the whole of that floor there was no one to be found save a crippled wretch of hideous aspect who it seems made his home there both he and the lascar stoutly swore that no one else had been in the front room during the afternoon so determined was their denial that the inspector was staggered and had almost come to believe that mrs st clair had been deluded when with a cry she sprang at a small deal box which lay upon the table and tore the lid from it out there fell a cascade of children s bricks it was the toy which he had promised to bring home this discovery and the evident confusion which the cripple showed made the inspector realise that the matter was serious the rooms were carefully examined and results all pointed to an abominable crime the front room was plainly furnished as a sitting room and led into a small bedroom which looked out upon the back of one of the wharves between the wharf and the bedroom window is a narrow strip which is dry at low tide but is covered at high tide with at least four and a half feet of water the bedroom window was a broad one and opened from below on examination traces of blood were to be seen upon the windowsill and several scattered drops were visible upon the wooden floor of the bedroom thrust away behind a curtain in the front room were all the clothes of mr neville st clair with the exception of his coat his boots his socks his hat and his watch all were there there were no signs of violence upon any of these garments and there were no other traces of mr neville st clair out of the window he must apparently have gone for no other exit could be discovered and the ominous bloodstains upon the sill gave little promise that he could save himself by swimming for the tide was at its very highest at the moment of the tragedy and now as to the villains who seemed to be immediately implicated in the matter the lascar was known to be a man of the vilest antecedents but as by mrs st clair s story he was known to have been at the foot of the stair within a very few seconds of her husband s appearance at the window he could hardly have been more than an accessory to the crime his defence was one of absolute ignorance and he protested that he had no knowledge as to the doings of hugh boone his lodger and that he could not account in any way for the presence of the missing gentleman s clothes so much for the lascar manager now for the sinister cripple who lives upon the second floor of the opium den and who was certainly the last human being whose eyes rested upon neville st clair his name is hugh boone and his hideous face is one which is familiar to every man who goes much to the city he is a professional beggar though in order to avoid the police regulations he pretends to a small trade in wax vestas some little distance down threadneedle street upon the left hand side there is as you may have remarked a small angle in the wall here it is that this creature takes his daily seat cross legged with his tiny stock of matches on his lap and as he is a piteous spectacle a small rain of charity descends into the greasy leather cap which lies upon the pavement beside him i have watched the fellow more than once before ever i thought of making his professional acquaintance and i have been surprised at the harvest which he has reaped in a short time his appearance you see is so remarkable that no one can pass him without observing him a shock of orange hair a pale face disfigured by a horrible scar which by its contraction has turned up the outer edge of his upper lip a bulldog chin and a pair of very penetrating dark eyes which present a singular contrast to the colour of his hair all mark him out from amid the common crowd of mendicants and so too does his wit for he is ever ready with a reply to any piece of chaff which may be thrown at him by the passers by this is the man whom we now learn to have been the lodger at the opium den and to have been the last man to see the gentleman of whom we are in quest but a cripple said i what could he have done single handed against a man in the prime of life he is a cripple in the sense that he walks with a limp but in other respects he appears to be a powerful and well nurtured man surely your medical experience would tell you watson that weakness in one limb is often compensated for by exceptional strength in the others pray continue your narrative mrs st clair had fainted at the sight of the blood upon the window and she was escorted home in a cab by the police as her presence could be of no help to them in their investigations inspector barton who had charge of the case made a very careful examination of the premises but without finding anything which threw any light upon the matter one mistake had been made in not arresting boone instantly as he was allowed some few minutes during which he might have communicated with his friend the lascar but this fault was soon remedied and he was seized and searched without anything being found which could incriminate him there were it is true some blood stains upon his right shirt sleeve but he pointed to his ring finger which had been cut near the nail and explained that the bleeding came from there adding that he had been to the window not long before and that the stains which had been observed there came doubtless from the same source he denied strenuously having ever seen mr neville st clair and swore that the presence of the clothes in his room was as much a mystery to him as to the police as to mrs st clair s assertion that she had actually seen her husband at the window he declared that she must have been either mad or dreaming he was removed loudly protesting to the police station while the inspector remained upon the premises in the hope that the ebbing tide might afford some fresh clue and it did though they hardly found upon the mud bank what they had feared to find it was neville st clair s coat and not neville st clair which lay uncovered as the tide receded and what do you think they found in the pockets i cannot imagine no i don t think you would guess every pocket stuffed with pennies and half pennies pennies and half pennies it was no wonder that it had not been swept away by the tide but a human body is a different matter there is a fierce eddy between the wharf and the house it seemed likely enough that the weighted coat had remained when the stripped body had been sucked away into the river but i understand that all the other clothes were found in the room would the body be dressed in a coat alone no sir but the facts might be met speciously enough suppose that this man boone had thrust neville st clair through the window there is no human eye which could have seen the deed what would he do then it would of course instantly strike him that he must get rid of the tell tale garments he would seize the coat then and be in the act of throwing it out when it would occur to him that it would swim and not sink he has little time for he has heard the scuffle downstairs when the wife tried to force her way up and perhaps he has already heard from his lascar confederate that the police are hurrying up the street there is not an instant to be lost he rushes to some secret hoard where he has accumulated the fruits of his beggary and he stuffs all the coins upon which he can lay his hands into the pockets to make sure of the coat s sinking he throws it out and would have done the same with the other garments had not he heard the rush of steps below and only just had time to close the window when the police appeared it certainly sounds feasible well we will take it as a working hypothesis for want of a better boone as i have told you was arrested and taken to the station but it could not be shown that there had ever before been anything against him he had for years been known as a professional beggar but his life appeared to have been a very quiet and innocent one there the matter stands at present and the questions which have to be solved what neville st clair was doing in the opium den what happened to him when there where is he now and what hugh boone had to do with his disappearance are all as far from a solution as ever i confess that i cannot recall any case within my experience which looked at the first glance so simple and yet which presented such difficulties while sherlock holmes had been detailing this singular series of events we had been whirling through the outskirts of the great town until the last straggling houses had been left behind and we rattled along with a country hedge upon either side of us just as he finished however we drove through two scattered villages where a few lights still glimmered in the windows we are on the outskirts of lee said my companion we have touched on three english counties in our short drive starting in middlesex passing over an angle of surrey and ending in kent see that light among the trees that is the cedars and beside that lamp sits a woman whose anxious ears have already i have little doubt caught the clink of our horse s feet but why are you not conducting the case from baker street i asked because there are many inquiries which must be made out here mrs st clair has most kindly put two rooms at my disposal and you may rest assured that she will have nothing but a welcome for my friend and colleague i hate to meet her watson when i have no news of her husband here we are whoa there whoa we had pulled up in front of a large villa which stood within its own grounds a stable boy had run out to the horse s head and springing down i followed holmes up the small winding gravel drive which led to the house as we approached the door flew open and a little blonde woman stood in the opening clad in some sort of light mousseline de soie with a touch of fluffy pink chiffon at her neck and wrists she stood with her figure outlined against the flood of light one hand upon the door one half raised in her eagerness her body slightly bent her head and face protruded with eager eyes and parted lips a standing question well she cried well and then seeing that there were two of us she gave a cry of hope which sank into a groan as she saw that my companion shook his head and shrugged his shoulders no good news none no bad no thank god for that but come in you must be weary for you have had a long day this is my friend dr watson he has been of most vital use to me in several of my cases and a lucky chance has made it possible for me to bring him out and associate him with this investigation i am delighted to see you said she pressing my hand warmly you will i am sure forgive anything that may be wanting in our arrangements when you consider the blow which has come so suddenly upon us my dear madam said i i am an old campaigner and if i were not i can very well see that no apology is needed if i can be of any assistance either to you or to my friend here i shall be indeed happy now mr sherlock holmes said the lady as we entered a well lit dining room upon the table of which a cold supper had been laid out i should very much like to ask you one or two plain questions to which i beg that you will give a plain answer certainly madam do not trouble about my feelings i am not hysterical nor given to fainting i simply wish to hear your real real opinion upon what point in your heart of hearts do you think that neville is alive sherlock holmes seemed to be embarrassed by the question frankly now she repeated standing upon the rug and looking keenly down at him as he leaned back in a basket chair frankly then madam i do not you think that he is dead i do murdered i don t say that perhaps and on what day did he meet his death on monday then perhaps mr holmes you will be good enough to explain how it is that i have received a letter from him to day sherlock holmes sprang out of his chair as if he had been galvanised what he roared yes to day she stood smiling holding up a little slip of paper in the air may i see it certainly he snatched it from her in his eagerness and smoothing it out upon the table he drew over the lamp and examined it intently i had left my chair and was gazing at it over his shoulder the envelope was a very coarse one and was stamped with the gravesend postmark and with the date of that very day or rather of the day before for it was considerably after midnight coarse writing murmured holmes surely this is not your husband s writing madam no but the enclosure is i perceive also that whoever addressed the envelope had to go and inquire as to the address how can you tell that the name you see is in perfectly black ink which has dried itself the rest is of the greyish colour which shows that blotting paper has been used if it had been written straight off and then blotted none would be of a deep black shade this man has written the name and there has then been a pause before he wrote the address which can only mean that he was not familiar with it it is of course a trifle but there is nothing so important as trifles let us now see the letter ha there has been an enclosure here yes there was a ring his signet ring and you are sure that this is your husband s hand one of his hands one his hand when he wrote hurriedly it is very unlike his usual writing and yet i know it well dearest do not be frightened all will come well there is a huge error which it may take some little time to rectify wait in patience neville written in pencil upon the fly leaf of a book octavo size no water mark hum posted to day in gravesend by a man with a dirty thumb ha and the flap has been gummed if i am not very much in error by a person who had been chewing tobacco and you have no doubt that it is your husband s hand madam none neville wrote those words and they were posted to day at gravesend well mrs st clair the clouds lighten though i should not venture to say that the danger is over but he must be alive mr holmes unless this is a clever forgery to put us on the wrong scent the ring after all proves nothing it may have been taken from him no no it is it is his very own writing very well it may however have been written on monday and only posted to day that is possible if so much may have happened between oh you must not discourage me mr holmes i know that all is well with him there is so keen a sympathy between us that i should know if evil came upon him on the very day that i saw him last he cut himself in the bedroom and yet i in the dining room rushed upstairs instantly with the utmost certainty that something had happened do you think that i would respond to such a trifle and yet be ignorant of his death i have seen too much not to know that the impression of a woman may be more valuable than the conclusion of an analytical reasoner and in this letter you certainly have a very strong piece of evidence to corroborate your view but if your husband is alive and able to write letters why should he remain away from you i cannot imagine it is unthinkable and on monday he made no remarks before leaving you no and you were surprised to see him in swandam lane very much so was the window open yes then he might have called to you he might he only as i understand gave an inarticulate cry yes a call for help you thought yes he waved his hands but it might have been a cry of surprise astonishment at the unexpected sight of you might cause him to throw up his hands it is possible and you thought he was pulled back he disappeared so suddenly he might have leaped back you did not see anyone else in the room no but this horrible man confessed to having been there and the lascar was at the foot of the stairs quite so your husband as far as you could see had his ordinary clothes on but without his collar or tie i distinctly saw his bare throat had he ever spoken of swandam lane never had he ever showed any signs of having taken opium never thank you mrs st clair those are the principal points about which i wished to be absolutely clear we shall now have a little supper and then retire for we may have a very busy day to morrow a large and comfortable double bedded room had been placed at our disposal and i was quickly between the sheets for i was weary after my night of adventure sherlock holmes was a man however who when he had an unsolved problem upon his mind would go for days and even for a week without rest turning it over rearranging his facts looking at it from every point of view until he had either fathomed it or convinced himself that his data were insufficient it was soon evident to me that he was now preparing for an all night sitting he took off his coat and waistcoat put on a large blue dressing gown and then wandered about the room collecting pillows from his bed and cushions from the sofa and armchairs with these he constructed a sort of eastern divan upon which he perched himself cross legged with an ounce of shag tobacco and a box of matches laid out in front of him in the dim light of the lamp i saw him sitting there an old briar pipe between his lips his eyes fixed vacantly upon the corner of the ceiling the blue smoke curling up from him silent motionless with the light shining upon his strong set aquiline features so he sat as i dropped off to sleep and so he sat when a sudden ejaculation caused me to wake up and i found the summer sun shining into the apartment the pipe was still between his lips the smoke still curled upward and the room was full of a dense tobacco haze but nothing remained of the heap of shag which i had seen upon the previous night awake watson he asked yes game for a morning drive certainly then dress no one is stirring yet but i know where the stable boy sleeps and we shall soon have the trap out he chuckled to himself as he spoke his eyes twinkled and he seemed a different man to the sombre thinker of the previous night as i dressed i glanced at my watch it was no wonder that no one was stirring it was twenty five minutes past four i had hardly finished when holmes returned with the news that the boy was putting in the horse i want to test a little theory of mine said he pulling on his boots i think watson that you are now standing in the presence of one of the most absolute fools in europe i deserve to be kicked from here to charing cross but i think i have the key of the affair now and where is it i asked smiling in the bathroom he answered oh yes i am not joking he continued seeing my look of incredulity i have just been there and i have taken it out and i have got it in this gladstone bag come on my boy and we shall see whether it will not fit the lock we made our way downstairs as quietly as possible and out into the bright morning sunshine in the road stood our horse and trap with the half clad stable boy waiting at the head we both sprang in and away we dashed down the london road a few country carts were stirring bearing in vegetables to the metropolis but the lines of villas on either side were as silent and lifeless as some city in a dream it has been in some points a singular case said holmes flicking the horse on into a gallop i confess that i have been as blind as a mole but it is better to learn wisdom late than never to learn it at all in town the earliest risers were just beginning to look sleepily from their windows as we drove through the streets of the surrey side passing down the waterloo bridge road we crossed over the river and dashing up wellington street wheeled sharply to the right and found ourselves in bow street sherlock holmes was well known to the force and the two constables at the door saluted him one of them held the horse s head while the other led us in who is on duty asked holmes inspector bradstreet sir ah bradstreet how are you a tall stout official had come down the stone flagged passage in a peaked cap and frogged jacket i wish to have a quiet word with you bradstreet certainly mr holmes step into my room here it was a small office like room with a huge ledger upon the table and a telephone projecting from the wall the inspector sat down at his desk what can i do for you mr holmes i called about that beggarman boone the one who was charged with being concerned in the disappearance of mr neville st clair of lee yes he was brought up and remanded for further inquiries so i heard you have him here in the cells is he quiet oh he gives no trouble but he is a dirty scoundrel dirty yes it is all we can do to make him wash his hands and his face is as black as a tinker s well when once his case has been settled he will have a regular prison bath and i think if you saw him you would agree with me that he needed it i should like to see him very much would you that is easily done come this way you can leave your bag no i think that i ll take it very good come this way if you please he led us down a passage opened a barred door passed down a winding stair and brought us to a whitewashed corridor with a line of doors on each side the third on the right is his said the inspector here it is he quietly shot back a panel in the upper part of the door and glanced through he is asleep said he you can see him very well we both put our eyes to the grating the prisoner lay with his face towards us in a very deep sleep breathing slowly and heavily he was a middle sized man coarsely clad as became his calling with a coloured shirt protruding through the rent in his tattered coat he was as the inspector had said extremely dirty but the grime which covered his face could not conceal its repulsive ugliness a broad wheal from an old scar ran right across it from eye to chin and by its contraction had turned up one side of the upper lip so that three teeth were exposed in a perpetual snarl a shock of very bright red hair grew low over his eyes and forehead he s a beauty isn t he said the inspector he certainly needs a wash remarked holmes i had an idea that he might and i took the liberty of bringing the tools with me he opened the gladstone bag as he spoke and took out to my astonishment a very large bath sponge he he you are a funny one chuckled the inspector now if you will have the great goodness to open that door very quietly we will soon make him cut a much more respectable figure well i don t know why not said the inspector he doesn t look a credit to the bow street cells does he he slipped his key into the lock and we all very quietly entered the cell the sleeper half turned and then settled down once more into a deep slumber holmes stooped to the water jug moistened his sponge and then rubbed it twice vigorously across and down the prisoner s face let me introduce you he shouted to mr neville st clair of lee in the county of kent never in my life have i seen such a sight the man s face peeled off under the sponge like the bark from a tree gone was the coarse brown tint gone too was the horrid scar which had seamed it across and the twisted lip which had given the repulsive sneer to the face a twitch brought away the tangled red hair and there sitting up in his bed was a pale sad faced refined looking man black haired and smooth skinned rubbing his eyes and staring about him with sleepy bewilderment then suddenly realising the exposure he broke into a scream and threw himself down with his face to the pillow great heavens cried the inspector it is indeed the missing man i know him from the photograph the prisoner turned with the reckless air of a man who abandons himself to his destiny be it so said he and pray what am i charged with with making away with mr neville st oh come you can t be charged with that unless they make a case of attempted suicide of it said the inspector with a grin well i have been twenty seven years in the force but this really takes the cake if i am mr neville st clair then it is obvious that no crime has been committed and that therefore i am illegally detained no crime but a very great error has been committed said holmes you would have done better to have trusted your wife it was not the wife it was the children groaned the prisoner god help me i would not have them ashamed of their father my god what an exposure what can i do sherlock holmes sat down beside him on the couch and patted him kindly on the shoulder if you leave it to a court of law to clear the matter up said he of course you can hardly avoid publicity on the other hand if you convince the police authorities that there is no possible case against you i do not know that there is any reason that the details should find their way into the papers inspector bradstreet would i am sure make notes upon anything which you might tell us and submit it to the proper authorities the case would then never go into court at all god bless you cried the prisoner passionately i would have endured imprisonment ay even execution rather than have left my miserable secret as a family blot to my children you are the first who have ever heard my story my father was a schoolmaster in chesterfield where i received an excellent education i travelled in my youth took to the stage and finally became a reporter on an evening paper in london one day my editor wished to have a series of articles upon begging in the metropolis and i volunteered to supply them there was the point from which all my adventures started it was only by trying begging as an amateur that i could get the facts upon which to base my articles when an actor i had of course learned all the secrets of making up and had been famous in the green room for my skill i took advantage now of my attainments i painted my face and to make myself as pitiable as possible i made a good scar and fixed one side of my lip in a twist by the aid of a small slip of flesh coloured plaster then with a red head of hair and an appropriate dress i took my station in the business part of the city ostensibly as a match seller but really as a beggar for seven hours i plied my trade and when i returned home in the evening i found to my surprise that i had received no less than s d i wrote my articles and thought little more of the matter until some time later i backed a bill for a friend and had a writ served upon me for i was at my wit s end where to get the money but a sudden idea came to me i begged a fortnight s grace from the creditor asked for a holiday from my employers and spent the time in begging in the city under my disguise in ten days i had the money and had paid the debt well you can imagine how hard it was to settle down to arduous work at a week when i knew that i could earn as much in a day by smearing my face with a little paint laying my cap on the ground and sitting still it was a long fight between my pride and the money but the dollars won at last and i threw up reporting and sat day after day in the corner which i had first chosen inspiring pity by my ghastly face and filling my pockets with coppers only one man knew my secret he was the keeper of a low den in which i used to lodge in swandam lane where i could every morning emerge as a squalid beggar and in the evenings transform myself into a well dressed man about town this fellow a lascar was well paid by me for his rooms so that i knew that my secret was safe in his possession well very soon i found that i was saving considerable sums of money i do not mean that any beggar in the streets of london could earn a year which is less than my average takings but i had exceptional advantages in my power of making up and also in a facility of repartee which improved by practice and made me quite a recognised character in the city all day a stream of pennies varied by silver poured in upon me and it was a very bad day in which i failed to take as i grew richer i grew more ambitious took a house in the country and eventually married without anyone having a suspicion as to my real occupation my dear wife knew that i had business in the city she little knew what last monday i had finished for the day and was dressing in my room above the opium den when i looked out of my window and saw to my horror and astonishment that my wife was standing in the street with her eyes fixed full upon me i gave a cry of surprise threw up my arms to cover my face and rushing to my confidant the lascar entreated him to prevent anyone from coming up to me i heard her voice downstairs but i knew that she could not ascend swiftly i threw off my clothes pulled on those of a beggar and put on my pigments and wig even a wife s eyes could not pierce so complete a disguise but then it occurred to me that there might be a search in the room and that the clothes might betray me i threw open the window reopening by my violence a small cut which i had inflicted upon myself in the bedroom that morning then i seized my coat which was weighted by the coppers which i had just transferred to it from the leather bag in which i carried my takings i hurled it out of the window and it disappeared into the thames the other clothes would have followed but at that moment there was a rush of constables up the stair and a few minutes after i found rather i confess to my relief that instead of being identified as mr neville st clair i was arrested as his murderer i do not know that there is anything else for me to explain i was determined to preserve my disguise as long as possible and hence my preference for a dirty face knowing that my wife would be terribly anxious i slipped off my ring and confided it to the lascar at a moment when no constable was watching me together with a hurried scrawl telling her that she had no cause to fear that note only reached her yesterday said holmes good god what a week she must have spent the police have watched this lascar said inspector bradstreet and i can quite understand that he might find it difficult to post a letter unobserved probably he handed it to some sailor customer of his who forgot all about it for some days that was it said holmes nodding approvingly i have no doubt of it but have you never been prosecuted for begging many times but what was a fine to me it must stop here however said bradstreet if the police are to hush this thing up there must be no more of hugh boone i have sworn it by the most solemn oaths which a man can take in that case i think that it is probable that no further steps may be taken but if you are found again then all must come out i am sure mr holmes that we are very much indebted to you for having cleared the matter up i wish i knew how you reach your results i reached this one said my friend by sitting upon five pillows and consuming an ounce of shag i think watson that if we drive to baker street we shall just be in time for breakfast vii the adventure of the blue carbuncle i had called upon my friend sherlock holmes upon the second morning after christmas with the intention of wishing him the compliments of the season he was lounging upon the sofa in a purple dressing gown a pipe rack within his reach upon the right and a pile of crumpled morning papers evidently newly studied near at hand beside the couch was a wooden chair and on the angle of the back hung a very seedy and disreputable hard felt hat much the worse for wear and cracked in several places a lens and a forceps lying upon the seat of the chair suggested that the hat had been suspended in this manner for the purpose of examination you are engaged said i perhaps i interrupt you not at all i am glad to have a friend with whom i can discuss my results the matter is a perfectly trivial one he jerked his thumb in the direction of the old hat but there are points in connection with it which are not entirely devoid of interest and even of instruction i seated myself in his armchair and warmed my hands before his crackling fire for a sharp frost had set in and the windows were thick with the ice crystals i suppose i remarked that homely as it looks this thing has some deadly story linked on to it that it is the clue which will guide you in the solution of some mystery and the punishment of some crime no no no crime said sherlock holmes laughing only one of those whimsical little incidents which will happen when you have four million human beings all jostling each other within the space of a few square miles amid the action and reaction of so dense a swarm of humanity every possible combination of events may be expected to take place and many a little problem will be presented which may be striking and bizarre without being criminal we have already had experience of such so much so i remarked that of the last six cases which i have added to my notes three have been entirely free of any legal crime precisely you allude to my attempt to recover the irene adler papers to the singular case of miss mary sutherland and to the adventure of the man with the twisted lip well i have no doubt that this small matter will fall into the same innocent category you know peterson the commissionaire yes it is to him that this trophy belongs it is his hat no no he found it its owner is unknown i beg that you will look upon it not as a battered billycock but as an intellectual problem and first as to how it came here it arrived upon christmas morning in company with a good fat goose which is i have no doubt roasting at this moment in front of peterson s fire the facts are these about four o clock on christmas morning peterson who as you know is a very honest fellow was returning from some small jollification and was making his way homeward down tottenham court road in front of him he saw in the gaslight a tallish man walking with a slight stagger and carrying a white goose slung over his shoulder as he reached the corner of goodge street a row broke out between this stranger and a little knot of roughs one of the latter knocked off the man s hat on which he raised his stick to defend himself and swinging it over his head smashed the shop window behind him peterson had rushed forward to protect the stranger from his assailants but the man shocked at having broken the window and seeing an official looking person in uniform rushing towards him dropped his goose took to his heels and vanished amid the labyrinth of small streets which lie at the back of tottenham court road the roughs had also fled at the appearance of peterson so that he was left in possession of the field of battle and also of the spoils of victory in the shape of this battered hat and a most unimpeachable christmas goose which surely he restored to their owner my dear fellow there lies the problem it is true that for mrs henry baker was printed upon a small card which was tied to the bird s left leg and it is also true that the initials h b are legible upon the lining of this hat but as there are some thousands of bakers and some hundreds of henry bakers in this city of ours it is not easy to restore lost property to any one of them what then did peterson do he brought round both hat and goose to me on christmas morning knowing that even the smallest problems are of interest to me the goose we retained until this morning when there were signs that in spite of the slight frost it would be well that it should be eaten without unnecessary delay its finder has carried it off therefore to fulfil the ultimate destiny of a goose while i continue to retain the hat of the unknown gentleman who lost his christmas dinner did he not advertise no then what clue could you have as to his identity only as much as we can deduce from his hat precisely but you are joking what can you gather from this old battered felt here is my lens you know my methods what can you gather yourself as to the individuality of the man who has worn this article i took the tattered object in my hands and turned it over rather ruefully it was a very ordinary black hat of the usual round shape hard and much the worse for wear the lining had been of red silk but was a good deal discoloured there was no maker s name but as holmes had remarked the initials h b were scrawled upon one side it was pierced in the brim for a hat securer but the elastic was missing for the rest it was cracked exceedingly dusty and spotted in several places although there seemed to have been some attempt to hide the discoloured patches by smearing them with ink i can see nothing said i handing it back to my friend on the contrary watson you can see everything you fail however to reason from what you see you are too timid in drawing your inferences then pray tell me what it is that you can infer from this hat he picked it up and gazed at it in the peculiar introspective fashion which was characteristic of him it is perhaps less suggestive than it might have been he remarked and yet there are a few inferences which are very distinct and a few others which represent at least a strong balance of probability that the man was highly intellectual is of course obvious upon the face of it and also that he was fairly well to do within the last three years although he has now fallen upon evil days he had foresight but has less now than formerly pointing to a moral retrogression which when taken with the decline of his fortunes seems to indicate some evil influence probably drink at work upon him this may account also for the obvious fact that his wife has ceased to love him my dear holmes he has however retained some degree of self respect he continued disregarding my remonstrance he is a man who leads a sedentary life goes out little is out of training entirely is middle aged has grizzled hair which he has had cut within the last few days and which he anoints with lime cream these are the more patent facts which are to be deduced from his hat also by the way that it is extremely improbable that he has gas laid on in his house you are certainly joking holmes not in the least is it possible that even now when i give you these results you are unable to see how they are attained i have no doubt that i am very stupid but i must confess that i am unable to follow you for example how did you deduce that this man was intellectual for answer holmes clapped the hat upon his head it came right over the forehead and settled upon the bridge of his nose it is a question of cubic capacity said he a man with so large a brain must have something in it the decline of his fortunes then this hat is three years old these flat brims curled at the edge came in then it is a hat of the very best quality look at the band of ribbed silk and the excellent lining if this man could afford to buy so expensive a hat three years ago and has had no hat since then he has assuredly gone down in the world well that is clear enough certainly but how about the foresight and the moral retrogression sherlock holmes laughed here is the foresight said he putting his finger upon the little disc and loop of the hat securer they are never sold upon hats if this man ordered one it is a sign of a certain amount of foresight since he went out of his way to take this precaution against the wind but since we see that he has broken the elastic and has not troubled to replace it it is obvious that he has less foresight now than formerly which is a distinct proof of a weakening nature on the other hand he has endeavoured to conceal some of these stains upon the felt by daubing them with ink which is a sign that he has not entirely lost his self respect your reasoning is certainly plausible the further points that he is middle aged that his hair is grizzled that it has been recently cut and that he uses lime cream are all to be gathered from a close examination of the lower part of the lining the lens discloses a large number of hair ends clean cut by the scissors of the barber they all appear to be adhesive and there is a distinct odour of lime cream this dust you will observe is not the gritty grey dust of the street but the fluffy brown dust of the house showing that it has been hung up indoors most of the time while the marks of moisture upon the inside are proof positive that the wearer perspired very freely and could therefore hardly be in the best of training but his wife you said that she had ceased to love him this hat has not been brushed for weeks when i see you my dear watson with a week s accumulation of dust upon your hat and when your wife allows you to go out in such a state i shall fear that you also have been unfortunate enough to lose your wife s affection but he might be a bachelor nay he was bringing home the goose as a peace offering to his wife remember the card upon the bird s leg you have an answer to everything but how on earth do you deduce that the gas is not laid on in his house one tallow stain or even two might come by chance but when i see no less than five i think that there can be little doubt that the individual must be brought into frequent contact with burning tallow walks upstairs at night probably with his hat in one hand and a guttering candle in the other anyhow he never got tallow stains from a gas jet are you satisfied well it is very ingenious said i laughing but since as you said just now there has been no crime committed and no harm done save the loss of a goose all this seems to be rather a waste of energy sherlock holmes had opened his mouth to reply when the door flew open and peterson the commissionaire rushed into the apartment with flushed cheeks and the face of a man who is dazed with astonishment the goose mr holmes the goose sir he gasped eh what of it then has it returned to life and flapped off through the kitchen window holmes twisted himself round upon the sofa to get a fairer view of the man s excited face see here sir see what my wife found in its crop he held out his hand and displayed upon the centre of the palm a brilliantly scintillating blue stone rather smaller than a bean in size but of such purity and radiance that it twinkled like an electric point in the dark hollow of his hand sherlock holmes sat up with a whistle by jove peterson said he this is treasure trove indeed i suppose you know what you have got a diamond sir a precious stone it cuts into glass as though it were putty it s more than a precious stone it is the precious stone not the countess of morcar s blue carbuncle i ejaculated precisely so i ought to know its size and shape seeing that i have read the advertisement about it in the times every day lately it is absolutely unique and its value can only be conjectured but the reward offered of is certainly not within a twentieth part of the market price a thousand pounds great lord of mercy the commissionaire plumped down into a chair and stared from one to the other of us that is the reward and i have reason to know that there are sentimental considerations in the background which would induce the countess to part with half her fortune if she could but recover the gem it was lost if i remember aright at the hotel cosmopolitan i remarked precisely so on december nd just five days ago john horner a plumber was accused of having abstracted it from the lady s jewel case the evidence against him was so strong that the case has been referred to the assizes i have some account of the matter here i believe he rummaged amid his newspapers glancing over the dates until at last he smoothed one out doubled it over and read the following paragraph hotel cosmopolitan jewel robbery john horner plumber was brought up upon the charge of having upon the nd inst abstracted from the jewel case of the countess of morcar the valuable gem known as the blue carbuncle james ryder upper attendant at the hotel gave his evidence to the effect that he had shown horner up to the dressing room of the countess of morcar upon the day of the robbery in order that he might solder the second bar of the grate which was loose he had remained with horner some little time but had finally been called away on returning he found that horner had disappeared that the bureau had been forced open and that the small morocco casket in which as it afterwards transpired the countess was accustomed to keep her jewel was lying empty upon the dressing table ryder instantly gave the alarm and horner was arrested the same evening but the stone could not be found either upon his person or in his rooms catherine cusack maid to the countess deposed to having heard ryder s cry of dismay on discovering the robbery and to having rushed into the room where she found matters as described by the last witness inspector bradstreet b division gave evidence as to the arrest of horner who struggled frantically and protested his innocence in the strongest terms evidence of a previous conviction for robbery having been given against the prisoner the magistrate refused to deal summarily with the offence but referred it to the assizes horner who had shown signs of intense emotion during the proceedings fainted away at the conclusion and was carried out of court hum so much for the police court said holmes thoughtfully tossing aside the paper the question for us now to solve is the sequence of events leading from a rifled jewel case at one end to the crop of a goose in tottenham court road at the other you see watson our little deductions have suddenly assumed a much more important and less innocent aspect here is the stone the stone came from the goose and the goose came from mr henry baker the gentleman with the bad hat and all the other characteristics with which i have bored you so now we must set ourselves very seriously to finding this gentleman and ascertaining what part he has played in this little mystery to do this we must try the simplest means first and these lie undoubtedly in an advertisement in all the evening papers if this fail i shall have recourse to other methods what will you say give me a pencil and that slip of paper now then found at the corner of goodge street a goose and a black felt hat mr henry baker can have the same by applying at this evening at b baker street that is clear and concise very but will he see it well he is sure to keep an eye on the papers since to a poor man the loss was a heavy one he was clearly so scared by his mischance in breaking the window and by the approach of peterson that he thought of nothing but flight but since then he must have bitterly regretted the impulse which caused him to drop his bird then again the introduction of his name will cause him to see it for everyone who knows him will direct his attention to it here you are peterson run down to the advertising agency and have this put in the evening papers in which sir oh in the globe star pall mall st james s gazette evening news standard echo and any others that occur to you very well sir and this stone ah yes i shall keep the stone thank you and i say peterson just buy a goose on your way back and leave it here with me for we must have one to give to this gentleman in place of the one which your family is now devouring when the commissionaire had gone holmes took up the stone and held it against the light it s a bonny thing said he just see how it glints and sparkles of course it is a nucleus and focus of crime every good stone is they are the devil s pet baits in the larger and older jewels every facet may stand for a bloody deed this stone is not yet twenty years old it was found in the banks of the amoy river in southern china and is remarkable in having every characteristic of the carbuncle save that it is blue in shade instead of ruby red in spite of its youth it has already a sinister history there have been two murders a vitriol throwing a suicide and several robberies brought about for the sake of this forty grain weight of crystallised charcoal who would think that so pretty a toy would be a purveyor to the gallows and the prison i ll lock it up in my strong box now and drop a line to the countess to say that we have it do you think that this man horner is innocent i cannot tell well then do you imagine that this other one henry baker had anything to do with the matter it is i think much more likely that henry baker is an absolutely innocent man who had no idea that the bird which he was carrying was of considerably more value than if it were made of solid gold that however i shall determine by a very simple test if we have an answer to our advertisement and you can do nothing until then nothing in that case i shall continue my professional round but i shall come back in the evening at the hour you have mentioned for i should like to see the solution of so tangled a business very glad to see you i dine at seven there is a woodcock i believe by the way in view of recent occurrences perhaps i ought to ask mrs hudson to examine its crop i had been delayed at a case and it was a little after half past six when i found myself in baker street once more as i approached the house i saw a tall man in a scotch bonnet with a coat which was buttoned up to his chin waiting outside in the bright semicircle which was thrown from the fanlight just as i arrived the door was opened and we were shown up together to holmes room mr henry baker i believe said he rising from his armchair and greeting his visitor with the easy air of geniality which he could so readily assume pray take this chair by the fire mr baker it is a cold night and i observe that your circulation is more adapted for summer than for winter ah watson you have just come at the right time is that your hat mr baker yes sir that is undoubtedly my hat he was a large man with rounded shoulders a massive head and a broad intelligent face sloping down to a pointed beard of grizzled brown a touch of red in nose and cheeks with a slight tremor of his extended hand recalled holmes surmise as to his habits his rusty black frock coat was buttoned right up in front with the collar turned up and his lank wrists protruded from his sleeves without a sign of cuff or shirt he spoke in a slow staccato fashion choosing his words with care and gave the impression generally of a man of learning and letters who had had ill usage at the hands of fortune we have retained these things for some days said holmes because we expected to see an advertisement from you giving your address i am at a loss to know now why you did not advertise our visitor gave a rather shamefaced laugh shillings have not been so plentiful with me as they once were he remarked i had no doubt that the gang of roughs who assaulted me had carried off both my hat and the bird i did not care to spend more money in a hopeless attempt at recovering them very naturally by the way about the bird we were compelled to eat it to eat it our visitor half rose from his chair in his excitement yes it would have been of no use to anyone had we not done so but i presume that this other goose upon the sideboard which is about the same weight and perfectly fresh will answer your purpose equally well oh certainly certainly answered mr baker with a sigh of relief of course we still have the feathers legs crop and so on of your own bird so if you wish the man burst into a hearty laugh they might be useful to me as relics of my adventure said he but beyond that i can hardly see what use the disjecta membra of my late acquaintance are going to be to me no sir i think that with your permission i will confine my attentions to the excellent bird which i perceive upon the sideboard sherlock holmes glanced sharply across at me with a slight shrug of his shoulders there is your hat then and there your bird said he by the way would it bore you to tell me where you got the other one from i am somewhat of a fowl fancier and i have seldom seen a better grown goose certainly sir said baker who had risen and tucked his newly gained property under his arm there are a few of us who frequent the alpha inn near the museum we are to be found in the museum itself during the day you understand this year our good host windigate by name instituted a goose club by which on consideration of some few pence every week we were each to receive a bird at christmas my pence were duly paid and the rest is familiar to you i am much indebted to you sir for a scotch bonnet is fitted neither to my years nor my gravity with a comical pomposity of manner he bowed solemnly to both of us and strode off upon his way so much for mr henry baker said holmes when he had closed the door behind him it is quite certain that he knows nothing whatever about the matter are you hungry watson not particularly then i suggest that we turn our dinner into a supper and follow up this clue while it is still hot by all means it was a bitter night so we drew on our ulsters and wrapped cravats about our throats outside the stars were shining coldly in a cloudless sky and the breath of the passers by blew out into smoke like so many pistol shots our footfalls rang out crisply and loudly as we swung through the doctors quarter wimpole street harley street and so through wigmore street into oxford street in a quarter of an hour we were in bloomsbury at the alpha inn which is a small public house at the corner of one of the streets which runs down into holborn holmes pushed open the door of the private bar and ordered two glasses of beer from the ruddy faced white aproned landlord your beer should be excellent if it is as good as your geese said he my geese the man seemed surprised yes i was speaking only half an hour ago to mr henry baker who was a member of your goose club ah yes i see but you see sir them s not our geese indeed whose then well i got the two dozen from a salesman in covent garden indeed i know some of them which was it breckinridge is his name ah i don t know him well here s your good health landlord and prosperity to your house good night now for mr breckinridge he continued buttoning up his coat as we came out into the frosty air remember watson that though we have so homely a thing as a goose at one end of this chain we have at the other a man who will certainly get seven years penal servitude unless we can establish his innocence it is possible that our inquiry may but confirm his guilt but in any case we have a line of investigation which has been missed by the police and which a singular chance has placed in our hands let us follow it out to the bitter end faces to the south then and quick march we passed across holborn down endell street and so through a zigzag of slums to covent garden market one of the largest stalls bore the name of breckinridge upon it and the proprietor a horsey looking man with a sharp face and trim side whiskers was helping a boy to put up the shutters good evening it s a cold night said holmes the salesman nodded and shot a questioning glance at my companion sold out of geese i see continued holmes pointing at the bare slabs of marble let you have five hundred to morrow morning that s no good well there are some on the stall with the gas flare ah but i was recommended to you who by the landlord of the alpha oh yes i sent him a couple of dozen fine birds they were too now where did you get them from to my surprise the question provoked a burst of anger from the salesman now then mister said he with his head cocked and his arms akimbo what are you driving at let s have it straight now it is straight enough i should like to know who sold you the geese which you supplied to the alpha well then i shan t tell you so now oh it is a matter of no importance but i don t know why you should be so warm over such a trifle warm you d be as warm maybe if you were as pestered as i am when i pay good money for a good article there should be an end of the business but it s where are the geese and who did you sell the geese to and what will you take for the geese one would think they were the only geese in the world to hear the fuss that is made over them well i have no connection with any other people who have been making inquiries said holmes carelessly if you won t tell us the bet is off that is all but i m always ready to back my opinion on a matter of fowls and i have a fiver on it that the bird i ate is country bred well then you ve lost your fiver for it s town bred snapped the salesman it s nothing of the kind i say it is i don t believe it d you think you know more about fowls than i who have handled them ever since i was a nipper i tell you all those birds that went to the alpha were town bred you ll never persuade me to believe that will you bet then it s merely taking your money for i know that i am right but i ll have a sovereign on with you just to teach you not to be obstinate the salesman chuckled grimly bring me the books bill said he the small boy brought round a small thin volume and a great greasy backed one laying them out together beneath the hanging lamp now then mr cocksure said the salesman i thought that i was out of geese but before i finish you ll find that there is still one left in my shop you see this little book well that s the list of the folk from whom i buy d you see well then here on this page are the country folk and the numbers after their names are where their accounts are in the big ledger now then you see this other page in red ink well that is a list of my town suppliers now look at that third name just read it out to me mrs oakshott brixton road read holmes quite so now turn that up in the ledger holmes turned to the page indicated here you are mrs oakshott brixton road egg and poultry supplier now then what s the last entry december nd twenty four geese at s d quite so there you are and underneath sold to mr windigate of the alpha at s what have you to say now sherlock holmes looked deeply chagrined he drew a sovereign from his pocket and threw it down upon the slab turning away with the air of a man whose disgust is too deep for words a few yards off he stopped under a lamp post and laughed in the hearty noiseless fashion which was peculiar to him when you see a man with whiskers of that cut and the pink un protruding out of his pocket you can always draw him by a bet said he i daresay that if i had put down in front of him that man would not have given me such complete information as was drawn from him by the idea that he was doing me on a wager well watson we are i fancy nearing the end of our quest and the only point which remains to be determined is whether we should go on to this mrs oakshott to night or whether we should reserve it for to morrow it is clear from what that surly fellow said that there are others besides ourselves who are anxious about the matter and i should his remarks were suddenly cut short by a loud hubbub which broke out from the stall which we had just left turning round we saw a little rat faced fellow standing in the centre of the circle of yellow light which was thrown by the swinging lamp while breckinridge the salesman framed in the door of his stall was shaking his fists fiercely at the cringing figure i ve had enough of you and your geese he shouted i wish you were all at the devil together if you come pestering me any more with your silly talk i ll set the dog at you you bring mrs oakshott here and i ll answer her but what have you to do with it did i buy the geese off you no but one of them was mine all the same whined the little man well then ask mrs oakshott for it she told me to ask you well you can ask the king of proosia for all i care i ve had enough of it get out of this he rushed fiercely forward and the inquirer flitted away into the darkness ha this may save us a visit to brixton road whispered holmes come with me and we will see what is to be made of this fellow striding through the scattered knots of people who lounged round the flaring stalls my companion speedily overtook the little man and touched him upon the shoulder he sprang round and i could see in the gas light that every vestige of colour had been driven from his face who are you then what do you want he asked in a quavering voice you will excuse me said holmes blandly but i could not help overhearing the questions which you put to the salesman just now i think that i could be of assistance to you you who are you how could you know anything of the matter my name is sherlock holmes it is my business to know what other people don t know but you can know nothing of this excuse me i know everything of it you are endeavouring to trace some geese which were sold by mrs oakshott of brixton road to a salesman named breckinridge by him in turn to mr windigate of the alpha and by him to his club of which mr henry baker is a member oh sir you are the very man whom i have longed to meet cried the little fellow with outstretched hands and quivering fingers i can hardly explain to you how interested i am in this matter sherlock holmes hailed a four wheeler which was passing in that case we had better discuss it in a cosy room rather than in this wind swept market place said he but pray tell me before we go farther who it is that i have the pleasure of assisting the man hesitated for an instant my name is john robinson he answered with a sidelong glance no no the real name said holmes sweetly it is always awkward doing business with an alias a flush sprang to the white cheeks of the stranger well then said he my real name is james ryder precisely so head attendant at the hotel cosmopolitan pray step into the cab and i shall soon be able to tell you everything which you would wish to know the little man stood glancing from one to the other of us with half frightened half hopeful eyes as one who is not sure whether he is on the verge of a windfall or of a catastrophe then he stepped into the cab and in half an hour we were back in the sitting room at baker street nothing had been said during our drive but the high thin breathing of our new companion and the claspings and unclaspings of his hands spoke of the nervous tension within him here we are said holmes cheerily as we filed into the room the fire looks very seasonable in this weather you look cold mr ryder pray take the basket chair i will just put on my slippers before we settle this little matter of yours now then you want to know what became of those geese yes sir or rather i fancy of that goose it was one bird i imagine in which you were interested white with a black bar across the tail ryder quivered with emotion oh sir he cried can you tell me where it went to it came here here yes and a most remarkable bird it proved i don t wonder that you should take an interest in it it laid an egg after it was dead the bonniest brightest little blue egg that ever was seen i have it here in my museum our visitor staggered to his feet and clutched the mantelpiece with his right hand holmes unlocked his strong box and held up the blue carbuncle which shone out like a star with a cold brilliant many pointed radiance ryder stood glaring with a drawn face uncertain whether to claim or to disown it the game s up ryder said holmes quietly hold up man or you ll be into the fire give him an arm back into his chair watson he s not got blood enough to go in for felony with impunity give him a dash of brandy so now he looks a little more human what a shrimp it is to be sure for a moment he had staggered and nearly fallen but the brandy brought a tinge of colour into his cheeks and he sat staring with frightened eyes at his accuser i have almost every link in my hands and all the proofs which i could possibly need so there is little which you need tell me still that little may as well be cleared up to make the case complete you had heard ryder of this blue stone of the countess of morcar s it was catherine cusack who told me of it said he in a crackling voice i see her ladyship s waiting maid well the temptation of sudden wealth so easily acquired was too much for you as it has been for better men before you but you were not very scrupulous in the means you used it seems to me ryder that there is the making of a very pretty villain in you you knew that this man horner the plumber had been concerned in some such matter before and that suspicion would rest the more readily upon him what did you do then you made some small job in my lady s room you and your confederate cusack and you managed that he should be the man sent for then when he had left you rifled the jewel case raised the alarm and had this unfortunate man arrested you then ryder threw himself down suddenly upon the rug and clutched at my companion s knees for god s sake have mercy he shrieked think of my father of my mother it would break their hearts i never went wrong before i never will again i swear it i ll swear it on a bible oh don t bring it into court for christ s sake don t get back into your chair said holmes sternly it is very well to cringe and crawl now but you thought little enough of this poor horner in the dock for a crime of which he knew nothing i will fly mr holmes i will leave the country sir then the charge against him will break down hum we will talk about that and now let us hear a true account of the next act how came the stone into the goose and how came the goose into the open market tell us the truth for there lies your only hope of safety ryder passed his tongue over his parched lips i will tell you it just as it happened sir said he when horner had been arrested it seemed to me that it would be best for me to get away with the stone at once for i did not know at what moment the police might not take it into their heads to search me and my room there was no place about the hotel where it would be safe i went out as if on some commission and i made for my sister s house she had married a man named oakshott and lived in brixton road where she fattened fowls for the market all the way there every man i met seemed to me to be a policeman or a detective and for all that it was a cold night the sweat was pouring down my face before i came to the brixton road my sister asked me what was the matter and why i was so pale but i told her that i had been upset by the jewel robbery at the hotel then i went into the back yard and smoked a pipe and wondered what it would be best to do i had a friend once called maudsley who went to the bad and has just been serving his time in pentonville one day he had met me and fell into talk about the ways of thieves and how they could get rid of what they stole i knew that he would be true to me for i knew one or two things about him so i made up my mind to go right on to kilburn where he lived and take him into my confidence he would show me how to turn the stone into money but how to get to him in safety i thought of the agonies i had gone through in coming from the hotel i might at any moment be seized and searched and there would be the stone in my waistcoat pocket i was leaning against the wall at the time and looking at the geese which were waddling about round my feet and suddenly an idea came into my head which showed me how i could beat the best detective that ever lived my sister had told me some weeks before that i might have the pick of her geese for a christmas present and i knew that she was always as good as her word i would take my goose now and in it i would carry my stone to kilburn there was a little shed in the yard and behind this i drove one of the birds a fine big one white with a barred tail i caught it and prying its bill open i thrust the stone down its throat as far as my finger could reach the bird gave a gulp and i felt the stone pass along its gullet and down into its crop but the creature flapped and struggled and out came my sister to know what was the matter as i turned to speak to her the brute broke loose and fluttered off among the others whatever were you doing with that bird jem says she well said i you said you d give me one for christmas and i was feeling which was the fattest oh says she we ve set yours aside for you jem s bird we call it it s the big white one over yonder there s twenty six of them which makes one for you and one for us and two dozen for the market thank you maggie says i but if it is all the same to you i d rather have that one i was handling just now the other is a good three pound heavier said she and we fattened it expressly for you never mind i ll have the other and i ll take it now said i oh just as you like said she a little huffed which is it you want then that white one with the barred tail right in the middle of the flock oh very well kill it and take it with you well i did what she said mr holmes and i carried the bird all the way to kilburn i told my pal what i had done for he was a man that it was easy to tell a thing like that to he laughed until he choked and we got a knife and opened the goose my heart turned to water for there was no sign of the stone and i knew that some terrible mistake had occurred i left the bird rushed back to my sister s and hurried into the back yard there was not a bird to be seen there where are they all maggie i cried gone to the dealer s jem which dealer s breckinridge of covent garden but was there another with a barred tail i asked the same as the one i chose yes jem there were two barred tailed ones and i could never tell them apart well then of course i saw it all and i ran off as hard as my feet would carry me to this man breckinridge but he had sold the lot at once and not one word would he tell me as to where they had gone you heard him yourselves to night well he has always answered me like that my sister thinks that i am going mad sometimes i think that i am myself and now and now i am myself a branded thief without ever having touched the wealth for which i sold my character god help me god help me he burst into convulsive sobbing with his face buried in his hands there was a long silence broken only by his heavy breathing and by the measured tapping of sherlock holmes finger tips upon the edge of the table then my friend rose and threw open the door get out said he what sir oh heaven bless you no more words get out and no more words were needed there was a rush a clatter upon the stairs the bang of a door and the crisp rattle of running footfalls from the street after all watson said holmes reaching up his hand for his clay pipe i am not retained by the police to supply their deficiencies if horner were in danger it would be another thing but this fellow will not appear against him and the case must collapse i suppose that i am commuting a felony but it is just possible that i am saving a soul this fellow will not go wrong again he is too terribly frightened send him to gaol now and you make him a gaol bird for life besides it is the season of forgiveness chance has put in our way a most singular and whimsical problem and its solution is its own reward if you will have the goodness to touch the bell doctor we will begin another investigation in which also a bird will be the chief feature viii the adventure of the speckled band on glancing over my notes of the seventy odd cases in which i have during the last eight years studied the methods of my friend sherlock holmes i find many tragic some comic a large number merely strange but none commonplace for working as he did rather for the love of his art than for the acquirement of wealth he refused to associate himself with any investigation which did not tend towards the unusual and even the fantastic of all these varied cases however i cannot recall any which presented more singular features than that which was associated with the well known surrey family of the roylotts of stoke moran the events in question occurred in the early days of my association with holmes when we were sharing rooms as bachelors in baker street it is possible that i might have placed them upon record before but a promise of secrecy was made at the time from which i have only been freed during the last month by the untimely death of the lady to whom the pledge was given it is perhaps as well that the facts should now come to light for i have reasons to know that there are widespread rumours as to the death of dr grimesby roylott which tend to make the matter even more terrible than the truth it was early in april in the year that i woke one morning to find sherlock holmes standing fully dressed by the side of my bed he was a late riser as a rule and as the clock on the mantelpiece showed me that it was only a quarter past seven i blinked up at him in some surprise and perhaps just a little resentment for i was myself regular in my habits very sorry to knock you up watson said he but it s the common lot this morning mrs hudson has been knocked up she retorted upon me and i on you what is it then a fire no a client it seems that a young lady has arrived in a considerable state of excitement who insists upon seeing me she is waiting now in the sitting room now when young ladies wander about the metropolis at this hour of the morning and knock sleepy people up out of their beds i presume that it is something very pressing which they have to communicate should it prove to be an interesting case you would i am sure wish to follow it from the outset i thought at any rate that i should call you and give you the chance my dear fellow i would not miss it for anything i had no keener pleasure than in following holmes in his professional investigations and in admiring the rapid deductions as swift as intuitions and yet always founded on a logical basis with which he unravelled the problems which were submitted to him i rapidly threw on my clothes and was ready in a few minutes to accompany my friend down to the sitting room a lady dressed in black and heavily veiled who had been sitting in the window rose as we entered good morning madam said holmes cheerily my name is sherlock holmes this is my intimate friend and associate dr watson before whom you can speak as freely as before myself ha i am glad to see that mrs hudson has had the good sense to light the fire pray draw up to it and i shall order you a cup of hot coffee for i observe that you are shivering it is not cold which makes me shiver said the woman in a low voice changing her seat as requested what then it is fear mr holmes it is terror she raised her veil as she spoke and we could see that she was indeed in a pitiable state of agitation her face all drawn and grey with restless frightened eyes like those of some hunted animal her features and figure were those of a woman of thirty but her hair was shot with premature grey and her expression was weary and haggard sherlock holmes ran her over with one of his quick all comprehensive glances you must not fear said he soothingly bending forward and patting her forearm we shall soon set matters right i have no doubt you have come in by train this morning i see you know me then no but i observe the second half of a return ticket in the palm of your left glove you must have started early and yet you had a good drive in a dog cart along heavy roads before you reached the station the lady gave a violent start and stared in bewilderment at my companion there is no mystery my dear madam said he smiling the left arm of your jacket is spattered with mud in no less than seven places the marks are perfectly fresh there is no vehicle save a dog cart which throws up mud in that way and then only when you sit on the left hand side of the driver whatever your reasons may be you are perfectly correct said she i started from home before six reached leatherhead at twenty past and came in by the first train to waterloo sir i can stand this strain no longer i shall go mad if it continues i have no one to turn to none save only one who cares for me and he poor fellow can be of little aid i have heard of you mr holmes i have heard of you from mrs farintosh whom you helped in the hour of her sore need it was from her that i had your address oh sir do you not think that you could help me too and at least throw a little light through the dense darkness which surrounds me at present it is out of my power to reward you for your services but in a month or six weeks i shall be married with the control of my own income and then at least you shall not find me ungrateful holmes turned to his desk and unlocking it drew out a small case book which he consulted farintosh said he ah yes i recall the case it was concerned with an opal tiara i think it was before your time watson i can only say madam that i shall be happy to devote the same care to your case as i did to that of your friend as to reward my profession is its own reward but you are at liberty to defray whatever expenses i may be put to at the time which suits you best and now i beg that you will lay before us everything that may help us in forming an opinion upon the matter alas replied our visitor the very horror of my situation lies in the fact that my fears are so vague and my suspicions depend so entirely upon small points which might seem trivial to another that even he to whom of all others i have a right to look for help and advice looks upon all that i tell him about it as the fancies of a nervous woman he does not say so but i can read it from his soothing answers and averted eyes but i have heard mr holmes that you can see deeply into the manifold wickedness of the human heart you may advise me how to walk amid the dangers which encompass me i am all attention madam my name is helen stoner and i am living with my stepfather who is the last survivor of one of the oldest saxon families in england the roylotts of stoke moran on the western border of surrey holmes nodded his head the name is familiar to me said he the family was at one time among the richest in england and the estates extended over the borders into berkshire in the north and hampshire in the west in the last century however four successive heirs were of a dissolute and wasteful disposition and the family ruin was eventually completed by a gambler in the days of the regency nothing was left save a few acres of ground and the two hundred year old house which is itself crushed under a heavy mortgage the last squire dragged out his existence there living the horrible life of an aristocratic pauper but his only son my stepfather seeing that he must adapt himself to the new conditions obtained an advance from a relative which enabled him to take a medical degree and went out to calcutta where by his professional skill and his force of character he established a large practice in a fit of anger however caused by some robberies which had been perpetrated in the house he beat his native butler to death and narrowly escaped a capital sentence as it was he suffered a long term of imprisonment and afterwards returned to england a morose and disappointed man when dr roylott was in india he married my mother mrs stoner the young widow of major general stoner of the bengal artillery my sister julia and i were twins and we were only two years old at the time of my mother s re marriage she had a considerable sum of money not less than a year and this she bequeathed to dr roylott entirely while we resided with him with a provision that a certain annual sum should be allowed to each of us in the event of our marriage shortly after our return to england my mother died she was killed eight years ago in a railway accident near crewe dr roylott then abandoned his attempts to establish himself in practice in london and took us to live with him in the old ancestral house at stoke moran the money which my mother had left was enough for all our wants and there seemed to be no obstacle to our happiness but a terrible change came over our stepfather about this time instead of making friends and exchanging visits with our neighbours who had at first been overjoyed to see a roylott of stoke moran back in the old family seat he shut himself up in his house and seldom came out save to indulge in ferocious quarrels with whoever might cross his path violence of temper approaching to mania has been hereditary in the men of the family and in my stepfather s case it had i believe been intensified by his long residence in the tropics a series of disgraceful brawls took place two of which ended in the police court until at last he became the terror of the village and the folks would fly at his approach for he is a man of immense strength and absolutely uncontrollable in his anger last week he hurled the local blacksmith over a parapet into a stream and it was only by paying over all the money which i could gather together that i was able to avert another public exposure he had no friends at all save the wandering gipsies and he would give these vagabonds leave to encamp upon the few acres of bramble covered land which represent the family estate and would accept in return the hospitality of their tents wandering away with them sometimes for weeks on end he has a passion also for indian animals which are sent over to him by a correspondent and he has at this moment a cheetah and a baboon which wander freely over his grounds and are feared by the villagers almost as much as their master you can imagine from what i say that my poor sister julia and i had no great pleasure in our lives no servant would stay with us and for a long time we did all the work of the house she was but thirty at the time of her death and yet her hair had already begun to whiten even as mine has your sister is dead then she died just two years ago and it is of her death that i wish to speak to you you can understand that living the life which i have described we were little likely to see anyone of our own age and position we had however an aunt my mother s maiden sister miss honoria westphail who lives near harrow and we were occasionally allowed to pay short visits at this lady s house julia went there at christmas two years ago and met there a half pay major of marines to whom she became engaged my stepfather learned of the engagement when my sister returned and offered no objection to the marriage but within a fortnight of the day which had been fixed for the wedding the terrible event occurred which has deprived me of my only companion sherlock holmes had been leaning back in his chair with his eyes closed and his head sunk in a cushion but he half opened his lids now and glanced across at his visitor pray be precise as to details said he it is easy for me to be so for every event of that dreadful time is seared into my memory the manor house is as i have already said very old and only one wing is now inhabited the bedrooms in this wing are on the ground floor the sitting rooms being in the central block of the buildings of these bedrooms the first is dr roylott s the second my sister s and the third my own there is no communication between them but they all open out into the same corridor do i make myself plain perfectly so the windows of the three rooms open out upon the lawn that fatal night dr roylott had gone to his room early though we knew that he had not retired to rest for my sister was troubled by the smell of the strong indian cigars which it was his custom to smoke she left her room therefore and came into mine where she sat for some time chatting about her approaching wedding at eleven o clock she rose to leave me but she paused at the door and looked back tell me helen said she have you ever heard anyone whistle in the dead of the night never said i i suppose that you could not possibly whistle yourself in your sleep certainly not but why because during the last few nights i have always about three in the morning heard a low clear whistle i am a light sleeper and it has awakened me i cannot tell where it came from perhaps from the next room perhaps from the lawn i thought that i would just ask you whether you had heard it no i have not it must be those wretched gipsies in the plantation very likely and yet if it were on the lawn i wonder that you did not hear it also ah but i sleep more heavily than you well it is of no great consequence at any rate she smiled back at me closed my door and a few moments later i heard her key turn in the lock indeed said holmes was it your custom always to lock yourselves in at night always and why i think that i mentioned to you that the doctor kept a cheetah and a baboon we had no feeling of security unless our doors were locked quite so pray proceed with your statement i could not sleep that night a vague feeling of impending misfortune impressed me my sister and i you will recollect were twins and you know how subtle are the links which bind two souls which are so closely allied it was a wild night the wind was howling outside and the rain was beating and splashing against the windows suddenly amid all the hubbub of the gale there burst forth the wild scream of a terrified woman i knew that it was my sister s voice i sprang from my bed wrapped a shawl round me and rushed into the corridor as i opened my door i seemed to hear a low whistle such as my sister described and a few moments later a clanging sound as if a mass of metal had fallen as i ran down the passage my sister s door was unlocked and revolved slowly upon its hinges i stared at it horror stricken not knowing what was about to issue from it by the light of the corridor lamp i saw my sister appear at the opening her face blanched with terror her hands groping for help her whole figure swaying to and fro like that of a drunkard i ran to her and threw my arms round her but at that moment her knees seemed to give way and she fell to the ground she writhed as one who is in terrible pain and her limbs were dreadfully convulsed at first i thought that she had not recognised me but as i bent over her she suddenly shrieked out in a voice which i shall never forget oh my god helen it was the band the speckled band there was something else which she would fain have said and she stabbed with her finger into the air in the direction of the doctor s room but a fresh convulsion seized her and choked her words i rushed out calling loudly for my stepfather and i met him hastening from his room in his dressing gown when he reached my sister s side she was unconscious and though he poured brandy down her throat and sent for medical aid from the village all efforts were in vain for she slowly sank and died without having recovered her consciousness such was the dreadful end of my beloved sister one moment said holmes are you sure about this whistle and metallic sound could you swear to it that was what the county coroner asked me at the inquiry it is my strong impression that i heard it and yet among the crash of the gale and the creaking of an old house i may possibly have been deceived was your sister dressed no she was in her night dress in her right hand was found the charred stump of a match and in her left a match box showing that she had struck a light and looked about her when the alarm took place that is important and what conclusions did the coroner come to he investigated the case with great care for dr roylott s conduct had long been notorious in the county but he was unable to find any satisfactory cause of death my evidence showed that the door had been fastened upon the inner side and the windows were blocked by old fashioned shutters with broad iron bars which were secured every night the walls were carefully sounded and were shown to be quite solid all round and the flooring was also thoroughly examined with the same result the chimney is wide but is barred up by four large staples it is certain therefore that my sister was quite alone when she met her end besides there were no marks of any violence upon her how about poison the doctors examined her for it but without success what do you think that this unfortunate lady died of then it is my belief that she died of pure fear and nervous shock though what it was that frightened her i cannot imagine were there gipsies in the plantation at the time yes there are nearly always some there ah and what did you gather from this allusion to a band a speckled band sometimes i have thought that it was merely the wild talk of delirium sometimes that it may have referred to some band of people perhaps to these very gipsies in the plantation i do not know whether the spotted handkerchiefs which so many of them wear over their heads might have suggested the strange adjective which she used holmes shook his head like a man who is far from being satisfied these are very deep waters said he pray go on with your narrative two years have passed since then and my life has been until lately lonelier than ever a month ago however a dear friend whom i have known for many years has done me the honour to ask my hand in marriage his name is armitage percy armitage the second son of mr armitage of crane water near reading my stepfather has offered no opposition to the match and we are to be married in the course of the spring two days ago some repairs were started in the west wing of the building and my bedroom wall has been pierced so that i have had to move into the chamber in which my sister died and to sleep in the very bed in which she slept imagine then my thrill of terror when last night as i lay awake thinking over her terrible fate i suddenly heard in the silence of the night the low whistle which had been the herald of her own death i sprang up and lit the lamp but nothing was to be seen in the room i was too shaken to go to bed again however so i dressed and as soon as it was daylight i slipped down got a dog cart at the crown inn which is opposite and drove to leatherhead from whence i have come on this morning with the one object of seeing you and asking your advice you have done wisely said my friend but have you told me all yes all miss roylott you have not you are screening your stepfather why what do you mean for answer holmes pushed back the frill of black lace which fringed the hand that lay upon our visitor s knee five little livid spots the marks of four fingers and a thumb were printed upon the white wrist you have been cruelly used said holmes the lady coloured deeply and covered over her injured wrist he is a hard man she said and perhaps he hardly knows his own strength there was a long silence during which holmes leaned his chin upon his hands and stared into the crackling fire this is a very deep business he said at last there are a thousand details which i should desire to know before i decide upon our course of action yet we have not a moment to lose if we were to come to stoke moran to day would it be possible for us to see over these rooms without the knowledge of your stepfather as it happens he spoke of coming into town to day upon some most important business it is probable that he will be away all day and that there would be nothing to disturb you we have a housekeeper now but she is old and foolish and i could easily get her out of the way excellent you are not averse to this trip watson by no means then we shall both come what are you going to do yourself i have one or two things which i would wish to do now that i am in town but i shall return by the twelve o clock train so as to be there in time for your coming and you may expect us early in the afternoon i have myself some small business matters to attend to will you not wait and breakfast no i must go my heart is lightened already since i have confided my trouble to you i shall look forward to seeing you again this afternoon she dropped her thick black veil over her face and glided from the room and what do you think of it all watson asked sherlock holmes leaning back in his chair it seems to me to be a most dark and sinister business dark enough and sinister enough yet if the lady is correct in saying that the flooring and walls are sound and that the door window and chimney are impassable then her sister must have been undoubtedly alone when she met her mysterious end what becomes then of these nocturnal whistles and what of the very peculiar words of the dying woman i cannot think when you combine the ideas of whistles at night the presence of a band of gipsies who are on intimate terms with this old doctor the fact that we have every reason to believe that the doctor has an interest in preventing his stepdaughter s marriage the dying allusion to a band and finally the fact that miss helen stoner heard a metallic clang which might have been caused by one of those metal bars that secured the shutters falling back into its place i think that there is good ground to think that the mystery may be cleared along those lines but what then did the gipsies do i cannot imagine i see many objections to any such theory and so do i it is precisely for that reason that we are going to stoke moran this day i want to see whether the objections are fatal or if they may be explained away but what in the name of the devil the ejaculation had been drawn from my companion by the fact that our door had been suddenly dashed open and that a huge man had framed himself in the aperture his costume was a peculiar mixture of the professional and of the agricultural having a black top hat a long frock coat and a pair of high gaiters with a hunting crop swinging in his hand so tall was he that his hat actually brushed the cross bar of the doorway and his breadth seemed to span it across from side to side a large face seared with a thousand wrinkles burned yellow with the sun and marked with every evil passion was turned from one to the other of us while his deep set bile shot eyes and his high thin fleshless nose gave him somewhat the resemblance to a fierce old bird of prey which of you is holmes asked this apparition my name sir but you have the advantage of me said my companion quietly i am dr grimesby roylott of stoke moran indeed doctor said holmes blandly pray take a seat i will do nothing of the kind my stepdaughter has been here i have traced her what has she been saying to you it is a little cold for the time of the year said holmes what has she been saying to you screamed the old man furiously but i have heard that the crocuses promise well continued my companion imperturbably ha you put me off do you said our new visitor taking a step forward and shaking his hunting crop i know you you scoundrel i have heard of you before you are holmes the meddler my friend smiled holmes the busybody his smile broadened holmes the scotland yard jack in office holmes chuckled heartily your conversation is most entertaining said he when you go out close the door for there is a decided draught i will go when i have had my say don t you dare to meddle with my affairs i know that miss stoner has been here i traced her i am a dangerous man to fall foul of see here he stepped swiftly forward seized the poker and bent it into a curve with his huge brown hands see that you keep yourself out of my grip he snarled and hurling the twisted poker into the fireplace he strode out of the room he seems a very amiable person said holmes laughing i am not quite so bulky but if he had remained i might have shown him that my grip was not much more feeble than his own as he spoke he picked up the steel poker and with a sudden effort straightened it out again fancy his having the insolence to confound me with the official detective force this incident gives zest to our investigation however and i only trust that our little friend will not suffer from her imprudence in allowing this brute to trace her and now watson we shall order breakfast and afterwards i shall walk down to doctors commons where i hope to get some data which may help us in this matter it was nearly one o clock when sherlock holmes returned from his excursion he held in his hand a sheet of blue paper scrawled over with notes and figures i have seen the will of the deceased wife said he to determine its exact meaning i have been obliged to work out the present prices of the investments with which it is concerned the total income which at the time of the wife s death was little short of is now through the fall in agricultural prices not more than each daughter can claim an income of in case of marriage it is evident therefore that if both girls had married this beauty would have had a mere pittance while even one of them would cripple him to a very serious extent my morning s work has not been wasted since it has proved that he has the very strongest motives for standing in the way of anything of the sort and now watson this is too serious for dawdling especially as the old man is aware that we are interesting ourselves in his affairs so if you are ready we shall call a cab and drive to waterloo i should be very much obliged if you would slip your revolver into your pocket an eley s no is an excellent argument with gentlemen who can twist steel pokers into knots that and a tooth brush are i think all that we need at waterloo we were fortunate in catching a train for leatherhead where we hired a trap at the station inn and drove for four or five miles through the lovely surrey lanes it was a perfect day with a bright sun and a few fleecy clouds in the heavens the trees and wayside hedges were just throwing out their first green shoots and the air was full of the pleasant smell of the moist earth to me at least there was a strange contrast between the sweet promise of the spring and this sinister quest upon which we were engaged my companion sat in the front of the trap his arms folded his hat pulled down over his eyes and his chin sunk upon his breast buried in the deepest thought suddenly however he started tapped me on the shoulder and pointed over the meadows look there said he a heavily timbered park stretched up in a gentle slope thickening into a grove at the highest point from amid the branches there jutted out the grey gables and high roof tree of a very old mansion stoke moran said he yes sir that be the house of dr grimesby roylott remarked the driver there is some building going on there said holmes that is where we are going there s the village said the driver pointing to a cluster of roofs some distance to the left but if you want to get to the house you ll find it shorter to get over this stile and so by the footpath over the fields there it is where the lady is walking and the lady i fancy is miss stoner observed holmes shading his eyes yes i think we had better do as you suggest we got off paid our fare and the trap rattled back on its way to leatherhead i thought it as well said holmes as we climbed the stile that this fellow should think we had come here as architects or on some definite business it may stop his gossip good afternoon miss stoner you see that we have been as good as our word our client of the morning had hurried forward to meet us with a face which spoke her joy i have been waiting so eagerly for you she cried shaking hands with us warmly all has turned out splendidly dr roylott has gone to town and it is unlikely that he will be back before evening we have had the pleasure of making the doctor s acquaintance said holmes and in a few words he sketched out what had occurred miss stoner turned white to the lips as she listened good heavens she cried he has followed me then so it appears he is so cunning that i never know when i am safe from him what will he say when he returns he must guard himself for he may find that there is someone more cunning than himself upon his track you must lock yourself up from him to night if he is violent we shall take you away to your aunt s at harrow now we must make the best use of our time so kindly take us at once to the rooms which we are to examine the building was of grey lichen blotched stone with a high central portion and two curving wings like the claws of a crab thrown out on each side in one of these wings the windows were broken and blocked with wooden boards while the roof was partly caved in a picture of ruin the central portion was in little better repair but the right hand block was comparatively modern and the blinds in the windows with the blue smoke curling up from the chimneys showed that this was where the family resided some scaffolding had been erected against the end wall and the stone work had been broken into but there were no signs of any workmen at the moment of our visit holmes walked slowly up and down the ill trimmed lawn and examined with deep attention the outsides of the windows this i take it belongs to the room in which you used to sleep the centre one to your sister s and the one next to the main building to dr roylott s chamber exactly so but i am now sleeping in the middle one pending the alterations as i understand by the way there does not seem to be any very pressing need for repairs at that end wall there were none i believe that it was an excuse to move me from my room ah that is suggestive now on the other side of this narrow wing runs the corridor from which these three rooms open there are windows in it of course yes but very small ones too narrow for anyone to pass through as you both locked your doors at night your rooms were unapproachable from that side now would you have the kindness to go into your room and bar your shutters miss stoner did so and holmes after a careful examination through the open window endeavoured in every way to force the shutter open but without success there was no slit through which a knife could be passed to raise the bar then with his lens he tested the hinges but they were of solid iron built firmly into the massive masonry hum said he scratching his chin in some perplexity my theory certainly presents some difficulties no one could pass these shutters if they were bolted well we shall see if the inside throws any light upon the matter a small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from which the three bedrooms opened holmes refused to examine the third chamber so we passed at once to the second that in which miss stoner was now sleeping and in which her sister had met with her fate it was a homely little room with a low ceiling and a gaping fireplace after the fashion of old country houses a brown chest of drawers stood in one corner a narrow white counterpaned bed in another and a dressing table on the left hand side of the window these articles with two small wicker work chairs made up all the furniture in the room save for a square of wilton carpet in the centre the boards round and the panelling of the walls were of brown worm eaten oak so old and discoloured that it may have dated from the original building of the house holmes drew one of the chairs into a corner and sat silent while his eyes travelled round and round and up and down taking in every detail of the apartment where does that bell communicate with he asked at last pointing to a thick bell rope which hung down beside the bed the tassel actually lying upon the pillow it goes to the housekeeper s room it looks newer than the other things yes it was only put there a couple of years ago your sister asked for it i suppose no i never heard of her using it we used always to get what we wanted for ourselves indeed it seemed unnecessary to put so nice a bell pull there you will excuse me for a few minutes while i satisfy myself as to this floor he threw himself down upon his face with his lens in his hand and crawled swiftly backward and forward examining minutely the cracks between the boards then he did the same with the wood work with which the chamber was panelled finally he walked over to the bed and spent some time in staring at it and in running his eye up and down the wall finally he took the bell rope in his hand and gave it a brisk tug why it s a dummy said he won t it ring no it is not even attached to a wire this is very interesting you can see now that it is fastened to a hook just above where the little opening for the ventilator is how very absurd i never noticed that before very strange muttered holmes pulling at the rope there are one or two very singular points about this room for example what a fool a builder must be to open a ventilator into another room when with the same trouble he might have communicated with the outside air that is also quite modern said the lady done about the same time as the bell rope remarked holmes yes there were several little changes carried out about that time they seem to have been of a most interesting character dummy bell ropes and ventilators which do not ventilate with your permission miss stoner we shall now carry our researches into the inner apartment dr grimesby roylott s chamber was larger than that of his step daughter but was as plainly furnished a camp bed a small wooden shelf full of books mostly of a technical character an armchair beside the bed a plain wooden chair against the wall a round table and a large iron safe were the principal things which met the eye holmes walked slowly round and examined each and all of them with the keenest interest what s in here he asked tapping the safe my stepfather s business papers oh you have seen inside then only once some years ago i remember that it was full of papers there isn t a cat in it for example no what a strange idea well look at this he took up a small saucer of milk which stood on the top of it no we don t keep a cat but there is a cheetah and a baboon ah yes of course well a cheetah is just a big cat and yet a saucer of milk does not go very far in satisfying its wants i daresay there is one point which i should wish to determine he squatted down in front of the wooden chair and examined the seat of it with the greatest attention thank you that is quite settled said he rising and putting his lens in his pocket hullo here is something interesting the object which had caught his eye was a small dog lash hung on one corner of the bed the lash however was curled upon itself and tied so as to make a loop of whipcord what do you make of that watson it s a common enough lash but i don t know why it should be tied that is not quite so common is it ah me it s a wicked world and when a clever man turns his brains to crime it is the worst of all i think that i have seen enough now miss stoner and with your permission we shall walk out upon the lawn i had never seen my friend s face so grim or his brow so dark as it was when we turned from the scene of this investigation we had walked several times up and down the lawn neither miss stoner nor myself liking to break in upon his thoughts before he roused himself from his reverie it is very essential miss stoner said he that you should absolutely follow my advice in every respect i shall most certainly do so the matter is too serious for any hesitation your life may depend upon your compliance i assure you that i am in your hands in the first place both my friend and i must spend the night in your room both miss stoner and i gazed at him in astonishment yes it must be so let me explain i believe that that is the village inn over there yes that is the crown very good your windows would be visible from there certainly you must confine yourself to your room on pretence of a headache when your stepfather comes back then when you hear him retire for the night you must open the shutters of your window undo the hasp put your lamp there as a signal to us and then withdraw quietly with everything which you are likely to want into the room which you used to occupy i have no doubt that in spite of the repairs you could manage there for one night oh yes easily the rest you will leave in our hands but what will you do we shall spend the night in your room and we shall investigate the cause of this noise which has disturbed you i believe mr holmes that you have already made up your mind said miss stoner laying her hand upon my companion s sleeve perhaps i have then for pity s sake tell me what was the cause of my sister s death i should prefer to have clearer proofs before i speak you can at least tell me whether my own thought is correct and if she died from some sudden fright no i do not think so i think that there was probably some more tangible cause and now miss stoner we must leave you for if dr roylott returned and saw us our journey would be in vain good bye and be brave for if you will do what i have told you you may rest assured that we shall soon drive away the dangers that threaten you sherlock holmes and i had no difficulty in engaging a bedroom and sitting room at the crown inn they were on the upper floor and from our window we could command a view of the avenue gate and of the inhabited wing of stoke moran manor house at dusk we saw dr grimesby roylott drive past his huge form looming up beside the little figure of the lad who drove him the boy had some slight difficulty in undoing the heavy iron gates and we heard the hoarse roar of the doctor s voice and saw the fury with which he shook his clinched fists at him the trap drove on and a few minutes later we saw a sudden light spring up among the trees as the lamp was lit in one of the sitting rooms do you know watson said holmes as we sat together in the gathering darkness i have really some scruples as to taking you to night there is a distinct element of danger can i be of assistance your presence might be invaluable then i shall certainly come it is very kind of you you speak of danger you have evidently seen more in these rooms than was visible to me no but i fancy that i may have deduced a little more i imagine that you saw all that i did i saw nothing remarkable save the bell rope and what purpose that could answer i confess is more than i can imagine you saw the ventilator too yes but i do not think that it is such a very unusual thing to have a small opening between two rooms it was so small that a rat could hardly pass through i knew that we should find a ventilator before ever we came to stoke moran my dear holmes oh yes i did you remember in her statement she said that her sister could smell dr roylott s cigar now of course that suggested at once that there must be a communication between the two rooms it could only be a small one or it would have been remarked upon at the coroner s inquiry i deduced a ventilator but what harm can there be in that well there is at least a curious coincidence of dates a ventilator is made a cord is hung and a lady who sleeps in the bed dies does not that strike you i cannot as yet see any connection did you observe anything very peculiar about that bed no it was clamped to the floor did you ever see a bed fastened like that before i cannot say that i have the lady could not move her bed it must always be in the same relative position to the ventilator and to the rope or so we may call it since it was clearly never meant for a bell pull holmes i cried i seem to see dimly what you are hinting at we are only just in time to prevent some subtle and horrible crime subtle enough and horrible enough when a doctor does go wrong he is the first of criminals he has nerve and he has knowledge palmer and pritchard were among the heads of their profession this man strikes even deeper but i think watson that we shall be able to strike deeper still but we shall have horrors enough before the night is over for goodness sake let us have a quiet pipe and turn our minds for a few hours to something more cheerful about nine o clock the light among the trees was extinguished and all was dark in the direction of the manor house two hours passed slowly away and then suddenly just at the stroke of eleven a single bright light shone out right in front of us that is our signal said holmes springing to his feet it comes from the middle window as we passed out he exchanged a few words with the landlord explaining that we were going on a late visit to an acquaintance and that it was possible that we might spend the night there a moment later we were out on the dark road a chill wind blowing in our faces and one yellow light twinkling in front of us through the gloom to guide us on our sombre errand there was little difficulty in entering the grounds for unrepaired breaches gaped in the old park wall making our way among the trees we reached the lawn crossed it and were about to enter through the window when out from a clump of laurel bushes there darted what seemed to be a hideous and distorted child who threw itself upon the grass with writhing limbs and then ran swiftly across the lawn into the darkness my god i whispered did you see it holmes was for the moment as startled as i his hand closed like a vice upon my wrist in his agitation then he broke into a low laugh and put his lips to my ear it is a nice household he murmured that is the baboon i had forgotten the strange pets which the doctor affected there was a cheetah too perhaps we might find it upon our shoulders at any moment i confess that i felt easier in my mind when after following holmes example and slipping off my shoes i found myself inside the bedroom my companion noiselessly closed the shutters moved the lamp onto the table and cast his eyes round the room all was as we had seen it in the daytime then creeping up to me and making a trumpet of his hand he whispered into my ear again so gently that it was all that i could do to distinguish the words the least sound would be fatal to our plans i nodded to show that i had heard we must sit without light he would see it through the ventilator i nodded again do not go asleep your very life may depend upon it have your pistol ready in case we should need it i will sit on the side of the bed and you in that chair i took out my revolver and laid it on the corner of the table holmes had brought up a long thin cane and this he placed upon the bed beside him by it he laid the box of matches and the stump of a candle then he turned down the lamp and we were left in darkness how shall i ever forget that dreadful vigil i could not hear a sound not even the drawing of a breath and yet i knew that my companion sat open eyed within a few feet of me in the same state of nervous tension in which i was myself the shutters cut off the least ray of light and we waited in absolute darkness from outside came the occasional cry of a night bird and once at our very window a long drawn catlike whine which told us that the cheetah was indeed at liberty far away we could hear the deep tones of the parish clock which boomed out every quarter of an hour how long they seemed those quarters twelve struck and one and two and three and still we sat waiting silently for whatever might befall suddenly there was the momentary gleam of a light up in the direction of the ventilator which vanished immediately but was succeeded by a strong smell of burning oil and heated metal someone in the next room had lit a dark lantern i heard a gentle sound of movement and then all was silent once more though the smell grew stronger for half an hour i sat with straining ears then suddenly another sound became audible a very gentle soothing sound like that of a small jet of steam escaping continually from a kettle the instant that we heard it holmes sprang from the bed struck a match and lashed furiously with his cane at the bell pull you see it watson he yelled you see it but i saw nothing at the moment when holmes struck the light i heard a low clear whistle but the sudden glare flashing into my weary eyes made it impossible for me to tell what it was at which my friend lashed so savagely i could however see that his face was deadly pale and filled with horror and loathing he had ceased to strike and was gazing up at the ventilator when suddenly there broke from the silence of the night the most horrible cry to which i have ever listened it swelled up louder and louder a hoarse yell of pain and fear and anger all mingled in the one dreadful shriek they say that away down in the village and even in the distant parsonage that cry raised the sleepers from their beds it struck cold to our hearts and i stood gazing at holmes and he at me until the last echoes of it had died away into the silence from which it rose what can it mean i gasped it means that it is all over holmes answered and perhaps after all it is for the best take your pistol and we will enter dr roylott s room with a grave face he lit the lamp and led the way down the corridor twice he struck at the chamber door without any reply from within then he turned the handle and entered i at his heels with the cocked pistol in my hand it was a singular sight which met our eyes on the table stood a dark lantern with the shutter half open throwing a brilliant beam of light upon the iron safe the door of which was ajar beside this table on the wooden chair sat dr grimesby roylott clad in a long grey dressing gown his bare ankles protruding beneath and his feet thrust into red heelless turkish slippers across his lap lay the short stock with the long lash which we had noticed during the day his chin was cocked upward and his eyes were fixed in a dreadful rigid stare at the corner of the ceiling round his brow he had a peculiar yellow band with brownish speckles which seemed to be bound tightly round his head as we entered he made neither sound nor motion the band the speckled band whispered holmes i took a step forward in an instant his strange headgear began to move and there reared itself from among his hair the squat diamond shaped head and puffed neck of a loathsome serpent it is a swamp adder cried holmes the deadliest snake in india he has died within ten seconds of being bitten violence does in truth recoil upon the violent and the schemer falls into the pit which he digs for another let us thrust this creature back into its den and we can then remove miss stoner to some place of shelter and let the county police know what has happened as he spoke he drew the dog whip swiftly from the dead man s lap and throwing the noose round the reptile s neck he drew it from its horrid perch and carrying it at arm s length threw it into the iron safe which he closed upon it such are the true facts of the death of dr grimesby roylott of stoke moran it is not necessary that i should prolong a narrative which has already run to too great a length by telling how we broke the sad news to the terrified girl how we conveyed her by the morning train to the care of her good aunt at harrow of how the slow process of official inquiry came to the conclusion that the doctor met his fate while indiscreetly playing with a dangerous pet the little which i had yet to learn of the case was told me by sherlock holmes as we travelled back next day i had said he come to an entirely erroneous conclusion which shows my dear watson how dangerous it always is to reason from insufficient data the presence of the gipsies and the use of the word band which was used by the poor girl no doubt to explain the appearance which she had caught a hurried glimpse of by the light of her match were sufficient to put me upon an entirely wrong scent i can only claim the merit that i instantly reconsidered my position when however it became clear to me that whatever danger threatened an occupant of the room could not come either from the window or the door my attention was speedily drawn as i have already remarked to you to this ventilator and to the bell rope which hung down to the bed the discovery that this was a dummy and that the bed was clamped to the floor instantly gave rise to the suspicion that the rope was there as a bridge for something passing through the hole and coming to the bed the idea of a snake instantly occurred to me and when i coupled it with my knowledge that the doctor was furnished with a supply of creatures from india i felt that i was probably on the right track the idea of using a form of poison which could not possibly be discovered by any chemical test was just such a one as would occur to a clever and ruthless man who had had an eastern training the rapidity with which such a poison would take effect would also from his point of view be an advantage it would be a sharp eyed coroner indeed who could distinguish the two little dark punctures which would show where the poison fangs had done their work then i thought of the whistle of course he must recall the snake before the morning light revealed it to the victim he had trained it probably by the use of the milk which we saw to return to him when summoned he would put it through this ventilator at the hour that he thought best with the certainty that it would crawl down the rope and land on the bed it might or might not bite the occupant perhaps she might escape every night for a week but sooner or later she must fall a victim i had come to these conclusions before ever i had entered his room an inspection of his chair showed me that he had been in the habit of standing on it which of course would be necessary in order that he should reach the ventilator the sight of the safe the saucer of milk and the loop of whipcord were enough to finally dispel any doubts which may have remained the metallic clang heard by miss stoner was obviously caused by her stepfather hastily closing the door of his safe upon its terrible occupant having once made up my mind you know the steps which i took in order to put the matter to the proof i heard the creature hiss as i have no doubt that you did also and i instantly lit the light and attacked it with the result of driving it through the ventilator and also with the result of causing it to turn upon its master at the other side some of the blows of my cane came home and roused its snakish temper so that it flew upon the first person it saw in this way i am no doubt indirectly responsible for dr grimesby roylott s death and i cannot say that it is likely to weigh very heavily upon my conscience ix the adventure of the engineer s thumb of all the problems which have been submitted to my friend mr sherlock holmes for solution during the years of our intimacy there were only two which i was the means of introducing to his notice that of mr hatherley s thumb and that of colonel warburton s madness of these the latter may have afforded a finer field for an acute and original observer but the other was so strange in its inception and so dramatic in its details that it may be the more worthy of being placed upon record even if it gave my friend fewer openings for those deductive methods of reasoning by which he achieved such remarkable results the story has i believe been told more than once in the newspapers but like all such narratives its effect is much less striking when set forth en bloc in a single half column of print than when the facts slowly evolve before your own eyes and the mystery clears gradually away as each new discovery furnishes a step which leads on to the complete truth at the time the circumstances made a deep impression upon me and the lapse of two years has hardly served to weaken the effect it was in the summer of not long after my marriage that the events occurred which i am now about to summarise i had returned to civil practice and had finally abandoned holmes in his baker street rooms although i continually visited him and occasionally even persuaded him to forgo his bohemian habits so far as to come and visit us my practice had steadily increased and as i happened to live at no very great distance from paddington station i got a few patients from among the officials one of these whom i had cured of a painful and lingering disease was never weary of advertising my virtues and of endeavouring to send me on every sufferer over whom he might have any influence one morning at a little before seven o clock i was awakened by the maid tapping at the door to announce that two men had come from paddington and were waiting in the consulting room i dressed hurriedly for i knew by experience that railway cases were seldom trivial and hastened downstairs as i descended my old ally the guard came out of the room and closed the door tightly behind him i ve got him here he whispered jerking his thumb over his shoulder he s all right what is it then i asked for his manner suggested that it was some strange creature which he had caged up in my room it s a new patient he whispered i thought i d bring him round myself then he couldn t slip away there he is all safe and sound i must go now doctor i have my dooties just the same as you and off he went this trusty tout without even giving me time to thank him i entered my consulting room and found a gentleman seated by the table he was quietly dressed in a suit of heather tweed with a soft cloth cap which he had laid down upon my books round one of his hands he had a handkerchief wrapped which was mottled all over with bloodstains he was young not more than five and twenty i should say with a strong masculine face but he was exceedingly pale and gave me the impression of a man who was suffering from some strong agitation which it took all his strength of mind to control i am sorry to knock you up so early doctor said he but i have had a very serious accident during the night i came in by train this morning and on inquiring at paddington as to where i might find a doctor a worthy fellow very kindly escorted me here i gave the maid a card but i see that she has left it upon the side table i took it up and glanced at it mr victor hatherley hydraulic engineer a victoria street rd floor that was the name style and abode of my morning visitor i regret that i have kept you waiting said i sitting down in my library chair you are fresh from a night journey i understand which is in itself a monotonous occupation oh my night could not be called monotonous said he and laughed he laughed very heartily with a high ringing note leaning back in his chair and shaking his sides all my medical instincts rose up against that laugh stop it i cried pull yourself together and i poured out some water from a caraffe it was useless however he was off in one of those hysterical outbursts which come upon a strong nature when some great crisis is over and gone presently he came to himself once more very weary and pale looking i have been making a fool of myself he gasped not at all drink this i dashed some brandy into the water and the colour began to come back to his bloodless cheeks that s better said he and now doctor perhaps you would kindly attend to my thumb or rather to the place where my thumb used to be he unwound the handkerchief and held out his hand it gave even my hardened nerves a shudder to look at it there were four protruding fingers and a horrid red spongy surface where the thumb should have been it had been hacked or torn right out from the roots good heavens i cried this is a terrible injury it must have bled considerably yes it did i fainted when it was done and i think that i must have been senseless for a long time when i came to i found that it was still bleeding so i tied one end of my handkerchief very tightly round the wrist and braced it up with a twig excellent you should have been a surgeon it is a question of hydraulics you see and came within my own province this has been done said i examining the wound by a very heavy and sharp instrument a thing like a cleaver said he an accident i presume by no means what a murderous attack very murderous indeed you horrify me i sponged the wound cleaned it dressed it and finally covered it over with cotton wadding and carbolised bandages he lay back without wincing though he bit his lip from time to time how is that i asked when i had finished capital between your brandy and your bandage i feel a new man i was very weak but i have had a good deal to go through perhaps you had better not speak of the matter it is evidently trying to your nerves oh no not now i shall have to tell my tale to the police but between ourselves if it were not for the convincing evidence of this wound of mine i should be surprised if they believed my statement for it is a very extraordinary one and i have not much in the way of proof with which to back it up and even if they believe me the clues which i can give them are so vague that it is a question whether justice will be done ha cried i if it is anything in the nature of a problem which you desire to see solved i should strongly recommend you to come to my friend mr sherlock holmes before you go to the official police oh i have heard of that fellow answered my visitor and i should be very glad if he would take the matter up though of course i must use the official police as well would you give me an introduction to him i ll do better i ll take you round to him myself i should be immensely obliged to you we ll call a cab and go together we shall just be in time to have a little breakfast with him do you feel equal to it yes i shall not feel easy until i have told my story then my servant will call a cab and i shall be with you in an instant i rushed upstairs explained the matter shortly to my wife and in five minutes was inside a hansom driving with my new acquaintance to baker street sherlock holmes was as i expected lounging about his sitting room in his dressing gown reading the agony column of the times and smoking his before breakfast pipe which was composed of all the plugs and dottles left from his smokes of the day before all carefully dried and collected on the corner of the mantelpiece he received us in his quietly genial fashion ordered fresh rashers and eggs and joined us in a hearty meal when it was concluded he settled our new acquaintance upon the sofa placed a pillow beneath his head and laid a glass of brandy and water within his reach it is easy to see that your experience has been no common one mr hatherley said he pray lie down there and make yourself absolutely at home tell us what you can but stop when you are tired and keep up your strength with a little stimulant thank you said my patient but i have felt another man since the doctor bandaged me and i think that your breakfast has completed the cure i shall take up as little of your valuable time as possible so i shall start at once upon my peculiar experiences holmes sat in his big armchair with the weary heavy lidded expression which veiled his keen and eager nature while i sat opposite to him and we listened in silence to the strange story which our visitor detailed to us you must know said he that i am an orphan and a bachelor residing alone in lodgings in london by profession i am a hydraulic engineer and i have had considerable experience of my work during the seven years that i was apprenticed to venner matheson the well known firm of greenwich two years ago having served my time and having also come into a fair sum of money through my poor father s death i determined to start in business for myself and took professional chambers in victoria street i suppose that everyone finds his first independent start in business a dreary experience to me it has been exceptionally so during two years i have had three consultations and one small job and that is absolutely all that my profession has brought me my gross takings amount to s every day from nine in the morning until four in the afternoon i waited in my little den until at last my heart began to sink and i came to believe that i should never have any practice at all yesterday however just as i was thinking of leaving the office my clerk entered to say there was a gentleman waiting who wished to see me upon business he brought up a card too with the name of colonel lysander stark engraved upon it close at his heels came the colonel himself a man rather over the middle size but of an exceeding thinness i do not think that i have ever seen so thin a man his whole face sharpened away into nose and chin and the skin of his cheeks was drawn quite tense over his outstanding bones yet this emaciation seemed to be his natural habit and due to no disease for his eye was bright his step brisk and his bearing assured he was plainly but neatly dressed and his age i should judge would be nearer forty than thirty mr hatherley said he with something of a german accent you have been recommended to me mr hatherley as being a man who is not only proficient in his profession but is also discreet and capable of preserving a secret i bowed feeling as flattered as any young man would at such an address may i ask who it was who gave me so good a character well perhaps it is better that i should not tell you that just at this moment i have it from the same source that you are both an orphan and a bachelor and are residing alone in london that is quite correct i answered but you will excuse me if i say that i cannot see how all this bears upon my professional qualifications i understand that it was on a professional matter that you wished to speak to me undoubtedly so but you will find that all i say is really to the point i have a professional commission for you but absolute secrecy is quite essential absolute secrecy you understand and of course we may expect that more from a man who is alone than from one who lives in the bosom of his family if i promise to keep a secret said i you may absolutely depend upon my doing so he looked very hard at me as i spoke and it seemed to me that i had never seen so suspicious and questioning an eye do you promise then said he at last yes i promise absolute and complete silence before during and after no reference to the matter at all either in word or writing i have already given you my word very good he suddenly sprang up and darting like lightning across the room he flung open the door the passage outside was empty that s all right said he coming back i know that clerks are sometimes curious as to their master s affairs now we can talk in safety he drew up his chair very close to mine and began to stare at me again with the same questioning and thoughtful look a feeling of repulsion and of something akin to fear had begun to rise within me at the strange antics of this fleshless man even my dread of losing a client could not restrain me from showing my impatience i beg that you will state your business sir said i my time is of value heaven forgive me for that last sentence but the words came to my lips how would fifty guineas for a night s work suit you he asked most admirably i say a night s work but an hour s would be nearer the mark i simply want your opinion about a hydraulic stamping machine which has got out of gear if you show us what is wrong we shall soon set it right ourselves what do you think of such a commission as that the work appears to be light and the pay munificent precisely so we shall want you to come to night by the last train where to to eyford in berkshire it is a little place near the borders of oxfordshire and within seven miles of reading there is a train from paddington which would bring you there at about very good i shall come down in a carriage to meet you there is a drive then yes our little place is quite out in the country it is a good seven miles from eyford station then we can hardly get there before midnight i suppose there would be no chance of a train back i should be compelled to stop the night yes we could easily give you a shake down that is very awkward could i not come at some more convenient hour we have judged it best that you should come late it is to recompense you for any inconvenience that we are paying to you a young and unknown man a fee which would buy an opinion from the very heads of your profession still of course if you would like to draw out of the business there is plenty of time to do so i thought of the fifty guineas and of how very useful they would be to me not at all said i i shall be very happy to accommodate myself to your wishes i should like however to understand a little more clearly what it is that you wish me to do quite so it is very natural that the pledge of secrecy which we have exacted from you should have aroused your curiosity i have no wish to commit you to anything without your having it all laid before you i suppose that we are absolutely safe from eavesdroppers entirely then the matter stands thus you are probably aware that fuller s earth is a valuable product and that it is only found in one or two places in england i have heard so some little time ago i bought a small place a very small place within ten miles of reading i was fortunate enough to discover that there was a deposit of fuller s earth in one of my fields on examining it however i found that this deposit was a comparatively small one and that it formed a link between two very much larger ones upon the right and left both of them however in the grounds of my neighbours these good people were absolutely ignorant that their land contained that which was quite as valuable as a gold mine naturally it was to my interest to buy their land before they discovered its true value but unfortunately i had no capital by which i could do this i took a few of my friends into the secret however and they suggested that we should quietly and secretly work our own little deposit and that in this way we should earn the money which would enable us to buy the neighbouring fields this we have now been doing for some time and in order to help us in our operations we erected a hydraulic press this press as i have already explained has got out of order and we wish your advice upon the subject we guard our secret very jealously however and if it once became known that we had hydraulic engineers coming to our little house it would soon rouse inquiry and then if the facts came out it would be good bye to any chance of getting these fields and carrying out our plans that is why i have made you promise me that you will not tell a human being that you are going to eyford to night i hope that i make it all plain i quite follow you said i the only point which i could not quite understand was what use you could make of a hydraulic press in excavating fuller s earth which as i understand is dug out like gravel from a pit ah said he carelessly we have our own process we compress the earth into bricks so as to remove them without revealing what they are but that is a mere detail i have taken you fully into my confidence now mr hatherley and i have shown you how i trust you he rose as he spoke i shall expect you then at eyford at i shall certainly be there and not a word to a soul he looked at me with a last long questioning gaze and then pressing my hand in a cold dank grasp he hurried from the room well when i came to think it all over in cool blood i was very much astonished as you may both think at this sudden commission which had been intrusted to me on the one hand of course i was glad for the fee was at least tenfold what i should have asked had i set a price upon my own services and it was possible that this order might lead to other ones on the other hand the face and manner of my patron had made an unpleasant impression upon me and i could not think that his explanation of the fuller s earth was sufficient to explain the necessity for my coming at midnight and his extreme anxiety lest i should tell anyone of my errand however i threw all fears to the winds ate a hearty supper drove to paddington and started off having obeyed to the letter the injunction as to holding my tongue at reading i had to change not only my carriage but my station however i was in time for the last train to eyford and i reached the little dim lit station after eleven o clock i was the only passenger who got out there and there was no one upon the platform save a single sleepy porter with a lantern as i passed out through the wicket gate however i found my acquaintance of the morning waiting in the shadow upon the other side without a word he grasped my arm and hurried me into a carriage the door of which was standing open he drew up the windows on either side tapped on the wood work and away we went as fast as the horse could go one horse interjected holmes yes only one did you observe the colour yes i saw it by the side lights when i was stepping into the carriage it was a chestnut tired looking or fresh oh fresh and glossy thank you i am sorry to have interrupted you pray continue your most interesting statement away we went then and we drove for at least an hour colonel lysander stark had said that it was only seven miles but i should think from the rate that we seemed to go and from the time that we took that it must have been nearer twelve he sat at my side in silence all the time and i was aware more than once when i glanced in his direction that he was looking at me with great intensity the country roads seem to be not very good in that part of the world for we lurched and jolted terribly i tried to look out of the windows to see something of where we were but they were made of frosted glass and i could make out nothing save the occasional bright blur of a passing light now and then i hazarded some remark to break the monotony of the journey but the colonel answered only in monosyllables and the conversation soon flagged at last however the bumping of the road was exchanged for the crisp smoothness of a gravel drive and the carriage came to a stand colonel lysander stark sprang out and as i followed after him pulled me swiftly into a porch which gaped in front of us we stepped as it were right out of the carriage and into the hall so that i failed to catch the most fleeting glance of the front of the house the instant that i had crossed the threshold the door slammed heavily behind us and i heard faintly the rattle of the wheels as the carriage drove away it was pitch dark inside the house and the colonel fumbled about looking for matches and muttering under his breath suddenly a door opened at the other end of the passage and a long golden bar of light shot out in our direction it grew broader and a woman appeared with a lamp in her hand which she held above her head pushing her face forward and peering at us i could see that she was pretty and from the gloss with which the light shone upon her dark dress i knew that it was a rich material she spoke a few words in a foreign tongue in a tone as though asking a question and when my companion answered in a gruff monosyllable she gave such a start that the lamp nearly fell from her hand colonel stark went up to her whispered something in her ear and then pushing her back into the room from whence she had come he walked towards me again with the lamp in his hand perhaps you will have the kindness to wait in this room for a few minutes said he throwing open another door it was a quiet little plainly furnished room with a round table in the centre on which several german books were scattered colonel stark laid down the lamp on the top of a harmonium beside the door i shall not keep you waiting an instant said he and vanished into the darkness i glanced at the books upon the table and in spite of my ignorance of german i could see that two of them were treatises on science the others being volumes of poetry then i walked across to the window hoping that i might catch some glimpse of the country side but an oak shutter heavily barred was folded across it it was a wonderfully silent house there was an old clock ticking loudly somewhere in the passage but otherwise everything was deadly still a vague feeling of uneasiness began to steal over me who were these german people and what were they doing living in this strange out of the way place and where was the place i was ten miles or so from eyford that was all i knew but whether north south east or west i had no idea for that matter reading and possibly other large towns were within that radius so the place might not be so secluded after all yet it was quite certain from the absolute stillness that we were in the country i paced up and down the room humming a tune under my breath to keep up my spirits and feeling that i was thoroughly earning my fifty guinea fee suddenly without any preliminary sound in the midst of the utter stillness the door of my room swung slowly open the woman was standing in the aperture the darkness of the hall behind her the yellow light from my lamp beating upon her eager and beautiful face i could see at a glance that she was sick with fear and the sight sent a chill to my own heart she held up one shaking finger to warn me to be silent and she shot a few whispered words of broken english at me her eyes glancing back like those of a frightened horse into the gloom behind her i would go said she trying hard as it seemed to me to speak calmly i would go i should not stay here there is no good for you to do but madam said i i have not yet done what i came for i cannot possibly leave until i have seen the machine it is not worth your while to wait she went on you can pass through the door no one hinders and then seeing that i smiled and shook my head she suddenly threw aside her constraint and made a step forward with her hands wrung together for the love of heaven she whispered get away from here before it is too late but i am somewhat headstrong by nature and the more ready to engage in an affair when there is some obstacle in the way i thought of my fifty guinea fee of my wearisome journey and of the unpleasant night which seemed to be before me was it all to go for nothing why should i slink away without having carried out my commission and without the payment which was my due this woman might for all i knew be a monomaniac with a stout bearing therefore though her manner had shaken me more than i cared to confess i still shook my head and declared my intention of remaining where i was she was about to renew her entreaties when a door slammed overhead and the sound of several footsteps was heard upon the stairs she listened for an instant threw up her hands with a despairing gesture and vanished as suddenly and as noiselessly as she had come the newcomers were colonel lysander stark and a short thick man with a chinchilla beard growing out of the creases of his double chin who was introduced to me as mr ferguson this is my secretary and manager said the colonel by the way i was under the impression that i left this door shut just now i fear that you have felt the draught on the contrary said i i opened the door myself because i felt the room to be a little close he shot one of his suspicious looks at me perhaps we had better proceed to business then said he mr ferguson and i will take you up to see the machine i had better put my hat on i suppose oh no it is in the house what you dig fuller s earth in the house no no this is only where we compress it but never mind that all we wish you to do is to examine the machine and to let us know what is wrong with it we went upstairs together the colonel first with the lamp the fat manager and i behind him it was a labyrinth of an old house with corridors passages narrow winding staircases and little low doors the thresholds of which were hollowed out by the generations who had crossed them there were no carpets and no signs of any furniture above the ground floor while the plaster was peeling off the walls and the damp was breaking through in green unhealthy blotches i tried to put on as unconcerned an air as possible but i had not forgotten the warnings of the lady even though i disregarded them and i kept a keen eye upon my two companions ferguson appeared to be a morose and silent man but i could see from the little that he said that he was at least a fellow countryman colonel lysander stark stopped at last before a low door which he unlocked within was a small square room in which the three of us could hardly get at one time ferguson remained outside and the colonel ushered me in we are now said he actually within the hydraulic press and it would be a particularly unpleasant thing for us if anyone were to turn it on the ceiling of this small chamber is really the end of the descending piston and it comes down with the force of many tons upon this metal floor there are small lateral columns of water outside which receive the force and which transmit and multiply it in the manner which is familiar to you the machine goes readily enough but there is some stiffness in the working of it and it has lost a little of its force perhaps you will have the goodness to look it over and to show us how we can set it right i took the lamp from him and i examined the machine very thoroughly it was indeed a gigantic one and capable of exercising enormous pressure when i passed outside however and pressed down the levers which controlled it i knew at once by the whishing sound that there was a slight leakage which allowed a regurgitation of water through one of the side cylinders an examination showed that one of the india rubber bands which was round the head of a driving rod had shrunk so as not quite to fill the socket along which it worked this was clearly the cause of the loss of power and i pointed it out to my companions who followed my remarks very carefully and asked several practical questions as to how they should proceed to set it right when i had made it clear to them i returned to the main chamber of the machine and took a good look at it to satisfy my own curiosity it was obvious at a glance that the story of the fuller s earth was the merest fabrication for it would be absurd to suppose that so powerful an engine could be designed for so inadequate a purpose the walls were of wood but the floor consisted of a large iron trough and when i came to examine it i could see a crust of metallic deposit all over it i had stooped and was scraping at this to see exactly what it was when i heard a muttered exclamation in german and saw the cadaverous face of the colonel looking down at me what are you doing there he asked i felt angry at having been tricked by so elaborate a story as that which he had told me i was admiring your fuller s earth said i i think that i should be better able to advise you as to your machine if i knew what the exact purpose was for which it was used the instant that i uttered the words i regretted the rashness of my speech his face set hard and a baleful light sprang up in his grey eyes very well said he you shall know all about the machine he took a step backward slammed the little door and turned the key in the lock i rushed towards it and pulled at the handle but it was quite secure and did not give in the least to my kicks and shoves hullo i yelled hullo colonel let me out and then suddenly in the silence i heard a sound which sent my heart into my mouth it was the clank of the levers and the swish of the leaking cylinder he had set the engine at work the lamp still stood upon the floor where i had placed it when examining the trough by its light i saw that the black ceiling was coming down upon me slowly jerkily but as none knew better than myself with a force which must within a minute grind me to a shapeless pulp i threw myself screaming against the door and dragged with my nails at the lock i implored the colonel to let me out but the remorseless clanking of the levers drowned my cries the ceiling was only a foot or two above my head and with my hand upraised i could feel its hard rough surface then it flashed through my mind that the pain of my death would depend very much upon the position in which i met it if i lay on my face the weight would come upon my spine and i shuddered to think of that dreadful snap easier the other way perhaps and yet had i the nerve to lie and look up at that deadly black shadow wavering down upon me already i was unable to stand erect when my eye caught something which brought a gush of hope back to my heart i have said that though the floor and ceiling were of iron the walls were of wood as i gave a last hurried glance around i saw a thin line of yellow light between two of the boards which broadened and broadened as a small panel was pushed backward for an instant i could hardly believe that here was indeed a door which led away from death the next instant i threw myself through and lay half fainting upon the other side the panel had closed again behind me but the crash of the lamp and a few moments afterwards the clang of the two slabs of metal told me how narrow had been my escape i was recalled to myself by a frantic plucking at my wrist and i found myself lying upon the stone floor of a narrow corridor while a woman bent over me and tugged at me with her left hand while she held a candle in her right it was the same good friend whose warning i had so foolishly rejected come come she cried breathlessly they will be here in a moment they will see that you are not there oh do not waste the so precious time but come this time at least i did not scorn her advice i staggered to my feet and ran with her along the corridor and down a winding stair the latter led to another broad passage and just as we reached it we heard the sound of running feet and the shouting of two voices one answering the other from the floor on which we were and from the one beneath my guide stopped and looked about her like one who is at her wit s end then she threw open a door which led into a bedroom through the window of which the moon was shining brightly it is your only chance said she it is high but it may be that you can jump it as she spoke a light sprang into view at the further end of the passage and i saw the lean figure of colonel lysander stark rushing forward with a lantern in one hand and a weapon like a butcher s cleaver in the other i rushed across the bedroom flung open the window and looked out how quiet and sweet and wholesome the garden looked in the moonlight and it could not be more than thirty feet down i clambered out upon the sill but i hesitated to jump until i should have heard what passed between my saviour and the ruffian who pursued me if she were ill used then at any risks i was determined to go back to her assistance the thought had hardly flashed through my mind before he was at the door pushing his way past her but she threw her arms round him and tried to hold him back fritz fritz she cried in english remember your promise after the last time you said it should not be again he will be silent oh he will be silent you are mad elise he shouted struggling to break away from her you will be the ruin of us he has seen too much let me pass i say he dashed her to one side and rushing to the window cut at me with his heavy weapon i had let myself go and was hanging by the hands to the sill when his blow fell i was conscious of a dull pain my grip loosened and i fell into the garden below i was shaken but not hurt by the fall so i picked myself up and rushed off among the bushes as hard as i could run for i understood that i was far from being out of danger yet suddenly however as i ran a deadly dizziness and sickness came over me i glanced down at my hand which was throbbing painfully and then for the first time saw that my thumb had been cut off and that the blood was pouring from my wound i endeavoured to tie my handkerchief round it but there came a sudden buzzing in my ears and next moment i fell in a dead faint among the rose bushes how long i remained unconscious i cannot tell it must have been a very long time for the moon had sunk and a bright morning was breaking when i came to myself my clothes were all sodden with dew and my coat sleeve was drenched with blood from my wounded thumb the smarting of it recalled in an instant all the particulars of my night s adventure and i sprang to my feet with the feeling that i might hardly yet be safe from my pursuers but to my astonishment when i came to look round me neither house nor garden were to be seen i had been lying in an angle of the hedge close by the high road and just a little lower down was a long building which proved upon my approaching it to be the very station at which i had arrived upon the previous night were it not for the ugly wound upon my hand all that had passed during those dreadful hours might have been an evil dream half dazed i went into the station and asked about the morning train there would be one to reading in less than an hour the same porter was on duty i found as had been there when i arrived i inquired of him whether he had ever heard of colonel lysander stark the name was strange to him had he observed a carriage the night before waiting for me no he had not was there a police station anywhere near there was one about three miles off it was too far for me to go weak and ill as i was i determined to wait until i got back to town before telling my story to the police it was a little past six when i arrived so i went first to have my wound dressed and then the doctor was kind enough to bring me along here i put the case into your hands and shall do exactly what you advise we both sat in silence for some little time after listening to this extraordinary narrative then sherlock holmes pulled down from the shelf one of the ponderous commonplace books in which he placed his cuttings here is an advertisement which will interest you said he it appeared in all the papers about a year ago listen to this lost on the th inst mr jeremiah hayling aged twenty six a hydraulic engineer left his lodgings at ten o clock at night and has not been heard of since was dressed in etc etc ha that represents the last time that the colonel needed to have his machine overhauled i fancy good heavens cried my patient then that explains what the girl said undoubtedly it is quite clear that the colonel was a cool and desperate man who was absolutely determined that nothing should stand in the way of his little game like those out and out pirates who will leave no survivor from a captured ship well every moment now is precious so if you feel equal to it we shall go down to scotland yard at once as a preliminary to starting for eyford some three hours or so afterwards we were all in the train together bound from reading to the little berkshire village there were sherlock holmes the hydraulic engineer inspector bradstreet of scotland yard a plain clothes man and myself bradstreet had spread an ordnance map of the county out upon the seat and was busy with his compasses drawing a circle with eyford for its centre there you are said he that circle is drawn at a radius of ten miles from the village the place we want must be somewhere near that line you said ten miles i think sir it was an hour s good drive and you think that they brought you back all that way when you were unconscious they must have done so i have a confused memory too of having been lifted and conveyed somewhere what i cannot understand said i is why they should have spared you when they found you lying fainting in the garden perhaps the villain was softened by the woman s entreaties i hardly think that likely i never saw a more inexorable face in my life oh we shall soon clear up all that said bradstreet well i have drawn my circle and i only wish i knew at what point upon it the folk that we are in search of are to be found i think i could lay my finger on it said holmes quietly really now cried the inspector you have formed your opinion come now we shall see who agrees with you i say it is south for the country is more deserted there and i say east said my patient i am for west remarked the plain clothes man there are several quiet little villages up there and i am for north said i because there are no hills there and our friend says that he did not notice the carriage go up any come cried the inspector laughing it s a very pretty diversity of opinion we have boxed the compass among us who do you give your casting vote to you are all wrong but we can t all be oh yes you can this is my point he placed his finger in the centre of the circle this is where we shall find them but the twelve mile drive gasped hatherley six out and six back nothing simpler you say yourself that the horse was fresh and glossy when you got in how could it be that if it had gone twelve miles over heavy roads indeed it is a likely ruse enough observed bradstreet thoughtfully of course there can be no doubt as to the nature of this gang none at all said holmes they are coiners on a large scale and have used the machine to form the amalgam which has taken the place of silver we have known for some time that a clever gang was at work said the inspector they have been turning out half crowns by the thousand we even traced them as far as reading but could get no farther for they had covered their traces in a way that showed that they were very old hands but now thanks to this lucky chance i think that we have got them right enough but the inspector was mistaken for those criminals were not destined to fall into the hands of justice as we rolled into eyford station we saw a gigantic column of smoke which streamed up from behind a small clump of trees in the neighbourhood and hung like an immense ostrich feather over the landscape a house on fire asked bradstreet as the train steamed off again on its way yes sir said the station master when did it break out i hear that it was during the night sir but it has got worse and the whole place is in a blaze whose house is it dr becher s tell me broke in the engineer is dr becher a german very thin with a long sharp nose the station master laughed heartily no sir dr becher is an englishman and there isn t a man in the parish who has a better lined waistcoat but he has a gentleman staying with him a patient as i understand who is a foreigner and he looks as if a little good berkshire beef would do him no harm the station master had not finished his speech before we were all hastening in the direction of the fire the road topped a low hill and there was a great widespread whitewashed building in front of us spouting fire at every chink and window while in the garden in front three fire engines were vainly striving to keep the flames under that s it cried hatherley in intense excitement there is the gravel drive and there are the rose bushes where i lay that second window is the one that i jumped from well at least said holmes you have had your revenge upon them there can be no question that it was your oil lamp which when it was crushed in the press set fire to the wooden walls though no doubt they were too excited in the chase after you to observe it at the time now keep your eyes open in this crowd for your friends of last night though i very much fear that they are a good hundred miles off by now and holmes fears came to be realised for from that day to this no word has ever been heard either of the beautiful woman the sinister german or the morose englishman early that morning a peasant had met a cart containing several people and some very bulky boxes driving rapidly in the direction of reading but there all traces of the fugitives disappeared and even holmes ingenuity failed ever to discover the least clue as to their whereabouts the firemen had been much perturbed at the strange arrangements which they had found within and still more so by discovering a newly severed human thumb upon a window sill of the second floor about sunset however their efforts were at last successful and they subdued the flames but not before the roof had fallen in and the whole place been reduced to such absolute ruin that save some twisted cylinders and iron piping not a trace remained of the machinery which had cost our unfortunate acquaintance so dearly large masses of nickel and of tin were discovered stored in an out house but no coins were to be found which may have explained the presence of those bulky boxes which have been already referred to how our hydraulic engineer had been conveyed from the garden to the spot where he recovered his senses might have remained forever a mystery were it not for the soft mould which told us a very plain tale he had evidently been carried down by two persons one of whom had remarkably small feet and the other unusually large ones on the whole it was most probable that the silent englishman being less bold or less murderous than his companion had assisted the woman to bear the unconscious man out of the way of danger well said our engineer ruefully as we took our seats to return once more to london it has been a pretty business for me i have lost my thumb and i have lost a fifty guinea fee and what have i gained experience said holmes laughing indirectly it may be of value you know you have only to put it into words to gain the reputation of being excellent company for the remainder of your existence x the adventure of the noble bachelor the lord st simon marriage and its curious termination have long ceased to be a subject of interest in those exalted circles in which the unfortunate bridegroom moves fresh scandals have eclipsed it and their more piquant details have drawn the gossips away from this four year old drama as i have reason to believe however that the full facts have never been revealed to the general public and as my friend sherlock holmes had a considerable share in clearing the matter up i feel that no memoir of him would be complete without some little sketch of this remarkable episode it was a few weeks before my own marriage during the days when i was still sharing rooms with holmes in baker street that he came home from an afternoon stroll to find a letter on the table waiting for him i had remained indoors all day for the weather had taken a sudden turn to rain with high autumnal winds and the jezail bullet which i had brought back in one of my limbs as a relic of my afghan campaign throbbed with dull persistence with my body in one easy chair and my legs upon another i had surrounded myself with a cloud of newspapers until at last saturated with the news of the day i tossed them all aside and lay listless watching the huge crest and monogram upon the envelope upon the table and wondering lazily who my friend s noble correspondent could be here is a very fashionable epistle i remarked as he entered your morning letters if i remember right were from a fish monger and a tide waiter yes my correspondence has certainly the charm of variety he answered smiling and the humbler are usually the more interesting this looks like one of those unwelcome social summonses which call upon a man either to be bored or to lie he broke the seal and glanced over the contents oh come it may prove to be something of interest after all not social then no distinctly professional and from a noble client one of the highest in england my dear fellow i congratulate you i assure you watson without affectation that the status of my client is a matter of less moment to me than the interest of his case it is just possible however that that also may not be wanting in this new investigation you have been reading the papers diligently of late have you not it looks like it said i ruefully pointing to a huge bundle in the corner i have had nothing else to do it is fortunate for you will perhaps be able to post me up i read nothing except the criminal news and the agony column the latter is always instructive but if you have followed recent events so closely you must have read about lord st simon and his wedding oh yes with the deepest interest that is well the letter which i hold in my hand is from lord st simon i will read it to you and in return you must turn over these papers and let me have whatever bears upon the matter this is what he says my dear mr sherlock holmes lord backwater tells me that i may place implicit reliance upon your judgment and discretion i have determined therefore to call upon you and to consult you in reference to the very painful event which has occurred in connection with my wedding mr lestrade of scotland yard is acting already in the matter but he assures me that he sees no objection to your co operation and that he even thinks that it might be of some assistance i will call at four o clock in the afternoon and should you have any other engagement at that time i hope that you will postpone it as this matter is of paramount importance yours faithfully robert st simon it is dated from grosvenor mansions written with a quill pen and the noble lord has had the misfortune to get a smear of ink upon the outer side of his right little finger remarked holmes as he folded up the epistle he says four o clock it is three now he will be here in an hour then i have just time with your assistance to get clear upon the subject turn over those papers and arrange the extracts in their order of time while i take a glance as to who our client is he picked a red covered volume from a line of books of reference beside the mantelpiece here he is said he sitting down and flattening it out upon his knee lord robert walsingham de vere st simon second son of the duke of balmoral hum arms azure three caltrops in chief over a fess sable born in he s forty one years of age which is mature for marriage was under secretary for the colonies in a late administration the duke his father was at one time secretary for foreign affairs they inherit plantagenet blood by direct descent and tudor on the distaff side ha well there is nothing very instructive in all this i think that i must turn to you watson for something more solid i have very little difficulty in finding what i want said i for the facts are quite recent and the matter struck me as remarkable i feared to refer them to you however as i knew that you had an inquiry on hand and that you disliked the intrusion of other matters oh you mean the little problem of the grosvenor square furniture van that is quite cleared up now though indeed it was obvious from the first pray give me the results of your newspaper selections here is the first notice which i can find it is in the personal column of the morning post and dates as you see some weeks back a marriage has been arranged it says and will if rumour is correct very shortly take place between lord robert st simon second son of the duke of balmoral and miss hatty doran the only daughter of aloysius doran esq of san francisco cal u s a that is all terse and to the point remarked holmes stretching his long thin legs towards the fire there was a paragraph amplifying this in one of the society papers of the same week ah here it is there will soon be a call for protection in the marriage market for the present free trade principle appears to tell heavily against our home product one by one the management of the noble houses of great britain is passing into the hands of our fair cousins from across the atlantic an important addition has been made during the last week to the list of the prizes which have been borne away by these charming invaders lord st simon who has shown himself for over twenty years proof against the little god s arrows has now definitely announced his approaching marriage with miss hatty doran the fascinating daughter of a california millionaire miss doran whose graceful figure and striking face attracted much attention at the westbury house festivities is an only child and it is currently reported that her dowry will run to considerably over the six figures with expectancies for the future as it is an open secret that the duke of balmoral has been compelled to sell his pictures within the last few years and as lord st simon has no property of his own save the small estate of birchmoor it is obvious that the californian heiress is not the only gainer by an alliance which will enable her to make the easy and common transition from a republican lady to a british peeress anything else asked holmes yawning oh yes plenty then there is another note in the morning post to say that the marriage would be an absolutely quiet one that it would be at st george s hanover square that only half a dozen intimate friends would be invited and that the party would return to the furnished house at lancaster gate which has been taken by mr aloysius doran two days later that is on wednesday last there is a curt announcement that the wedding had taken place and that the honeymoon would be passed at lord backwater s place near petersfield those are all the notices which appeared before the disappearance of the bride before the what asked holmes with a start the vanishing of the lady when did she vanish then at the wedding breakfast indeed this is more interesting than it promised to be quite dramatic in fact yes it struck me as being a little out of the common they often vanish before the ceremony and occasionally during the honeymoon but i cannot call to mind anything quite so prompt as this pray let me have the details i warn you that they are very incomplete perhaps we may make them less so such as they are they are set forth in a single article of a morning paper of yesterday which i will read to you it is headed singular occurrence at a fashionable wedding the family of lord robert st simon has been thrown into the greatest consternation by the strange and painful episodes which have taken place in connection with his wedding the ceremony as shortly announced in the papers of yesterday occurred on the previous morning but it is only now that it has been possible to confirm the strange rumours which have been so persistently floating about in spite of the attempts of the friends to hush the matter up so much public attention has now been drawn to it that no good purpose can be served by affecting to disregard what is a common subject for conversation the ceremony which was performed at st george s hanover square was a very quiet one no one being present save the father of the bride mr aloysius doran the duchess of balmoral lord backwater lord eustace and lady clara st simon the younger brother and sister of the bridegroom and lady alicia whittington the whole party proceeded afterwards to the house of mr aloysius doran at lancaster gate where breakfast had been prepared it appears that some little trouble was caused by a woman whose name has not been ascertained who endeavoured to force her way into the house after the bridal party alleging that she had some claim upon lord st simon it was only after a painful and prolonged scene that she was ejected by the butler and the footman the bride who had fortunately entered the house before this unpleasant interruption had sat down to breakfast with the rest when she complained of a sudden indisposition and retired to her room her prolonged absence having caused some comment her father followed her but learned from her maid that she had only come up to her chamber for an instant caught up an ulster and bonnet and hurried down to the passage one of the footmen declared that he had seen a lady leave the house thus apparelled but had refused to credit that it was his mistress believing her to be with the company on ascertaining that his daughter had disappeared mr aloysius doran in conjunction with the bridegroom instantly put themselves in communication with the police and very energetic inquiries are being made which will probably result in a speedy clearing up of this very singular business up to a late hour last night however nothing had transpired as to the whereabouts of the missing lady there are rumours of foul play in the matter and it is said that the police have caused the arrest of the woman who had caused the original disturbance in the belief that from jealousy or some other motive she may have been concerned in the strange disappearance of the bride and is that all only one little item in another of the morning papers but it is a suggestive one and it is that miss flora millar the lady who had caused the disturbance has actually been arrested it appears that she was formerly a danseuse at the allegro and that she has known the bridegroom for some years there are no further particulars and the whole case is in your hands now so far as it has been set forth in the public press and an exceedingly interesting case it appears to be i would not have missed it for worlds but there is a ring at the bell watson and as the clock makes it a few minutes after four i have no doubt that this will prove to be our noble client do not dream of going watson for i very much prefer having a witness if only as a check to my own memory lord robert st simon announced our page boy throwing open the door a gentleman entered with a pleasant cultured face high nosed and pale with something perhaps of petulance about the mouth and with the steady well opened eye of a man whose pleasant lot it had ever been to command and to be obeyed his manner was brisk and yet his general appearance gave an undue impression of age for he had a slight forward stoop and a little bend of the knees as he walked his hair too as he swept off his very curly brimmed hat was grizzled round the edges and thin upon the top as to his dress it was careful to the verge of foppishness with high collar black frock coat white waistcoat yellow gloves patent leather shoes and light coloured gaiters he advanced slowly into the room turning his head from left to right and swinging in his right hand the cord which held his golden eyeglasses good day lord st simon said holmes rising and bowing pray take the basket chair this is my friend and colleague dr watson draw up a little to the fire and we will talk this matter over a most painful matter to me as you can most readily imagine mr holmes i have been cut to the quick i understand that you have already managed several delicate cases of this sort sir though i presume that they were hardly from the same class of society no i am descending i beg pardon my last client of the sort was a king oh really i had no idea and which king the king of scandinavia what had he lost his wife you can understand said holmes suavely that i extend to the affairs of my other clients the same secrecy which i promise to you in yours of course very right very right i m sure i beg pardon as to my own case i am ready to give you any information which may assist you in forming an opinion thank you i have already learned all that is in the public prints nothing more i presume that i may take it as correct this article for example as to the disappearance of the bride lord st simon glanced over it yes it is correct as far as it goes but it needs a great deal of supplementing before anyone could offer an opinion i think that i may arrive at my facts most directly by questioning you pray do so when did you first meet miss hatty doran in san francisco a year ago you were travelling in the states yes did you become engaged then no but you were on a friendly footing i was amused by her society and she could see that i was amused her father is very rich he is said to be the richest man on the pacific slope and how did he make his money in mining he had nothing a few years ago then he struck gold invested it and came up by leaps and bounds now what is your own impression as to the young lady s your wife s character the nobleman swung his glasses a little faster and stared down into the fire you see mr holmes said he my wife was twenty before her father became a rich man during that time she ran free in a mining camp and wandered through woods or mountains so that her education has come from nature rather than from the schoolmaster she is what we call in england a tomboy with a strong nature wild and free unfettered by any sort of traditions she is impetuous volcanic i was about to say she is swift in making up her mind and fearless in carrying out her resolutions on the other hand i would not have given her the name which i have the honour to bear he gave a little stately cough had i not thought her to be at bottom a noble woman i believe that she is capable of heroic self sacrifice and that anything dishonourable would be repugnant to her have you her photograph i brought this with me he opened a locket and showed us the full face of a very lovely woman it was not a photograph but an ivory miniature and the artist had brought out the full effect of the lustrous black hair the large dark eyes and the exquisite mouth holmes gazed long and earnestly at it then he closed the locket and handed it back to lord st simon the young lady came to london then and you renewed your acquaintance yes her father brought her over for this last london season i met her several times became engaged to her and have now married her she brought i understand a considerable dowry a fair dowry not more than is usual in my family and this of course remains to you since the marriage is a fait accompli i really have made no inquiries on the subject very naturally not did you see miss doran on the day before the wedding yes was she in good spirits never better she kept talking of what we should do in our future lives indeed that is very interesting and on the morning of the wedding she was as bright as possible at least until after the ceremony and did you observe any change in her then well to tell the truth i saw then the first signs that i had ever seen that her temper was just a little sharp the incident however was too trivial to relate and can have no possible bearing upon the case pray let us have it for all that oh it is childish she dropped her bouquet as we went towards the vestry she was passing the front pew at the time and it fell over into the pew there was a moment s delay but the gentleman in the pew handed it up to her again and it did not appear to be the worse for the fall yet when i spoke to her of the matter she answered me abruptly and in the carriage on our way home she seemed absurdly agitated over this trifling cause indeed you say that there was a gentleman in the pew some of the general public were present then oh yes it is impossible to exclude them when the church is open this gentleman was not one of your wife s friends no no i call him a gentleman by courtesy but he was quite a common looking person i hardly noticed his appearance but really i think that we are wandering rather far from the point lady st simon then returned from the wedding in a less cheerful frame of mind than she had gone to it what did she do on re entering her father s house i saw her in conversation with her maid and who is her maid alice is her name she is an american and came from california with her a confidential servant a little too much so it seemed to me that her mistress allowed her to take great liberties still of course in america they look upon these things in a different way how long did she speak to this alice oh a few minutes i had something else to think of you did not overhear what they said lady st simon said something about jumping a claim she was accustomed to use slang of the kind i have no idea what she meant american slang is very expressive sometimes and what did your wife do when she finished speaking to her maid she walked into the breakfast room on your arm no alone she was very independent in little matters like that then after we had sat down for ten minutes or so she rose hurriedly muttered some words of apology and left the room she never came back but this maid alice as i understand deposes that she went to her room covered her bride s dress with a long ulster put on a bonnet and went out quite so and she was afterwards seen walking into hyde park in company with flora millar a woman who is now in custody and who had already made a disturbance at mr doran s house that morning ah yes i should like a few particulars as to this young lady and your relations to her lord st simon shrugged his shoulders and raised his eyebrows we have been on a friendly footing for some years i may say on a very friendly footing she used to be at the allegro i have not treated her ungenerously and she had no just cause of complaint against me but you know what women are mr holmes flora was a dear little thing but exceedingly hot headed and devotedly attached to me she wrote me dreadful letters when she heard that i was about to be married and to tell the truth the reason why i had the marriage celebrated so quietly was that i feared lest there might be a scandal in the church she came to mr doran s door just after we returned and she endeavoured to push her way in uttering very abusive expressions towards my wife and even threatening her but i had foreseen the possibility of something of the sort and i had two police fellows there in private clothes who soon pushed her out again she was quiet when she saw that there was no good in making a row did your wife hear all this no thank goodness she did not and she was seen walking with this very woman afterwards yes that is what mr lestrade of scotland yard looks upon as so serious it is thought that flora decoyed my wife out and laid some terrible trap for her well it is a possible supposition you think so too i did not say a probable one but you do not yourself look upon this as likely i do not think flora would hurt a fly still jealousy is a strange transformer of characters pray what is your own theory as to what took place well really i came to seek a theory not to propound one i have given you all the facts since you ask me however i may say that it has occurred to me as possible that the excitement of this affair the consciousness that she had made so immense a social stride had the effect of causing some little nervous disturbance in my wife in short that she had become suddenly deranged well really when i consider that she has turned her back i will not say upon me but upon so much that many have aspired to without success i can hardly explain it in any other fashion well certainly that is also a conceivable hypothesis said holmes smiling and now lord st simon i think that i have nearly all my data may i ask whether you were seated at the breakfast table so that you could see out of the window we could see the other side of the road and the park quite so then i do not think that i need to detain you longer i shall communicate with you should you be fortunate enough to solve this problem said our client rising i have solved it eh what was that i say that i have solved it where then is my wife that is a detail which i shall speedily supply lord st simon shook his head i am afraid that it will take wiser heads than yours or mine he remarked and bowing in a stately old fashioned manner he departed it is very good of lord st simon to honour my head by putting it on a level with his own said sherlock holmes laughing i think that i shall have a whisky and soda and a cigar after all this cross questioning i had formed my conclusions as to the case before our client came into the room my dear holmes i have notes of several similar cases though none as i remarked before which were quite as prompt my whole examination served to turn my conjecture into a certainty circumstantial evidence is occasionally very convincing as when you find a trout in the milk to quote thoreau s example but i have heard all that you have heard without however the knowledge of pre existing cases which serves me so well there was a parallel instance in aberdeen some years back and something on very much the same lines at munich the year after the franco prussian war it is one of these cases but hullo here is lestrade good afternoon lestrade you will find an extra tumbler upon the sideboard and there are cigars in the box the official detective was attired in a pea jacket and cravat which gave him a decidedly nautical appearance and he carried a black canvas bag in his hand with a short greeting he seated himself and lit the cigar which had been offered to him what s up then asked holmes with a twinkle in his eye you look dissatisfied and i feel dissatisfied it is this infernal st simon marriage case i can make neither head nor tail of the business really you surprise me who ever heard of such a mixed affair every clue seems to slip through my fingers i have been at work upon it all day and very wet it seems to have made you said holmes laying his hand upon the arm of the pea jacket yes i have been dragging the serpentine in heaven s name what for in search of the body of lady st simon sherlock holmes leaned back in his chair and laughed heartily have you dragged the basin of trafalgar square fountain he asked why what do you mean because you have just as good a chance of finding this lady in the one as in the other lestrade shot an angry glance at my companion i suppose you know all about it he snarled well i have only just heard the facts but my mind is made up oh indeed then you think that the serpentine plays no part in the matter i think it very unlikely then perhaps you will kindly explain how it is that we found this in it he opened his bag as he spoke and tumbled onto the floor a wedding dress of watered silk a pair of white satin shoes and a bride s wreath and veil all discoloured and soaked in water there said he putting a new wedding ring upon the top of the pile there is a little nut for you to crack master holmes oh indeed said my friend blowing blue rings into the air you dragged them from the serpentine no they were found floating near the margin by a park keeper they have been identified as her clothes and it seemed to me that if the clothes were there the body would not be far off by the same brilliant reasoning every man s body is to be found in the neighbourhood of his wardrobe and pray what did you hope to arrive at through this at some evidence implicating flora millar in the disappearance i am afraid that you will find it difficult are you indeed now cried lestrade with some bitterness i am afraid holmes that you are not very practical with your deductions and your inferences you have made two blunders in as many minutes this dress does implicate miss flora millar and how in the dress is a pocket in the pocket is a card case in the card case is a note and here is the very note he slapped it down upon the table in front of him listen to this you will see me when all is ready come at once f h m now my theory all along has been that lady st simon was decoyed away by flora millar and that she with confederates no doubt was responsible for her disappearance here signed with her initials is the very note which was no doubt quietly slipped into her hand at the door and which lured her within their reach very good lestrade said holmes laughing you really are very fine indeed let me see it he took up the paper in a listless way but his attention instantly became riveted and he gave a little cry of satisfaction this is indeed important said he ha you find it so extremely so i congratulate you warmly lestrade rose in his triumph and bent his head to look why he shrieked you re looking at the wrong side on the contrary this is the right side the right side you re mad here is the note written in pencil over here and over here is what appears to be the fragment of a hotel bill which interests me deeply there s nothing in it i looked at it before said lestrade oct th rooms s breakfast s d cocktail s lunch s d glass sherry d i see nothing in that very likely not it is most important all the same as to the note it is important also or at least the initials are so i congratulate you again i ve wasted time enough said lestrade rising i believe in hard work and not in sitting by the fire spinning fine theories good day mr holmes and we shall see which gets to the bottom of the matter first he gathered up the garments thrust them into the bag and made for the door just one hint to you lestrade drawled holmes before his rival vanished i will tell you the true solution of the matter lady st simon is a myth there is not and there never has been any such person lestrade looked sadly at my companion then he turned to me tapped his forehead three times shook his head solemnly and hurried away he had hardly shut the door behind him when holmes rose to put on his overcoat there is something in what the fellow says about outdoor work he remarked so i think watson that i must leave you to your papers for a little it was after five o clock when sherlock holmes left me but i had no time to be lonely for within an hour there arrived a confectioner s man with a very large flat box this he unpacked with the help of a youth whom he had brought with him and presently to my very great astonishment a quite epicurean little cold supper began to be laid out upon our humble lodging house mahogany there were a couple of brace of cold woodcock a pheasant a p t de foie gras pie with a group of ancient and cobwebby bottles having laid out all these luxuries my two visitors vanished away like the genii of the arabian nights with no explanation save that the things had been paid for and were ordered to this address just before nine o clock sherlock holmes stepped briskly into the room his features were gravely set but there was a light in his eye which made me think that he had not been disappointed in his conclusions they have laid the supper then he said rubbing his hands you seem to expect company they have laid for five yes i fancy we may have some company dropping in said he i am surprised that lord st simon has not already arrived ha i fancy that i hear his step now upon the stairs it was indeed our visitor of the afternoon who came bustling in dangling his glasses more vigorously than ever and with a very perturbed expression upon his aristocratic features my messenger reached you then asked holmes yes and i confess that the contents startled me beyond measure have you good authority for what you say the best possible lord st simon sank into a chair and passed his hand over his forehead what will the duke say he murmured when he hears that one of the family has been subjected to such humiliation it is the purest accident i cannot allow that there is any humiliation ah you look on these things from another standpoint i fail to see that anyone is to blame i can hardly see how the lady could have acted otherwise though her abrupt method of doing it was undoubtedly to be regretted having no mother she had no one to advise her at such a crisis it was a slight sir a public slight said lord st simon tapping his fingers upon the table you must make allowance for this poor girl placed in so unprecedented a position i will make no allowance i am very angry indeed and i have been shamefully used i think that i heard a ring said holmes yes there are steps on the landing if i cannot persuade you to take a lenient view of the matter lord st simon i have brought an advocate here who may be more successful he opened the door and ushered in a lady and gentleman lord st simon said he allow me to introduce you to mr and mrs francis hay moulton the lady i think you have already met at the sight of these newcomers our client had sprung from his seat and stood very erect with his eyes cast down and his hand thrust into the breast of his frock coat a picture of offended dignity the lady had taken a quick step forward and had held out her hand to him but he still refused to raise his eyes it was as well for his resolution perhaps for her pleading face was one which it was hard to resist you re angry robert said she well i guess you have every cause to be pray make no apology to me said lord st simon bitterly oh yes i know that i have treated you real bad and that i should have spoken to you before i went but i was kind of rattled and from the time when i saw frank here again i just didn t know what i was doing or saying i only wonder i didn t fall down and do a faint right there before the altar perhaps mrs moulton you would like my friend and me to leave the room while you explain this matter if i may give an opinion remarked the strange gentleman we ve had just a little too much secrecy over this business already for my part i should like all europe and america to hear the rights of it he was a small wiry sunburnt man clean shaven with a sharp face and alert manner then i ll tell our story right away said the lady frank here and i met in in mcquire s camp near the rockies where pa was working a claim we were engaged to each other frank and i but then one day father struck a rich pocket and made a pile while poor frank here had a claim that petered out and came to nothing the richer pa grew the poorer was frank so at last pa wouldn t hear of our engagement lasting any longer and he took me away to frisco frank wouldn t throw up his hand though so he followed me there and he saw me without pa knowing anything about it it would only have made him mad to know so we just fixed it all up for ourselves frank said that he would go and make his pile too and never come back to claim me until he had as much as pa so then i promised to wait for him to the end of time and pledged myself not to marry anyone else while he lived why shouldn t we be married right away then said he and then i will feel sure of you and i won t claim to be your husband until i come back well we talked it over and he had fixed it all up so nicely with a clergyman all ready in waiting that we just did it right there and then frank went off to seek his fortune and i went back to pa the next i heard of frank was that he was in montana and then he went prospecting in arizona and then i heard of him from new mexico after that came a long newspaper story about how a miners camp had been attacked by apache indians and there was my frank s name among the killed i fainted dead away and i was very sick for months after pa thought i had a decline and took me to half the doctors in frisco not a word of news came for a year and more so that i never doubted that frank was really dead then lord st simon came to frisco and we came to london and a marriage was arranged and pa was very pleased but i felt all the time that no man on this earth would ever take the place in my heart that had been given to my poor frank still if i had married lord st simon of course i d have done my duty by him we can t command our love but we can our actions i went to the altar with him with the intention to make him just as good a wife as it was in me to be but you may imagine what i felt when just as i came to the altar rails i glanced back and saw frank standing and looking at me out of the first pew i thought it was his ghost at first but when i looked again there he was still with a kind of question in his eyes as if to ask me whether i were glad or sorry to see him i wonder i didn t drop i know that everything was turning round and the words of the clergyman were just like the buzz of a bee in my ear i didn t know what to do should i stop the service and make a scene in the church i glanced at him again and he seemed to know what i was thinking for he raised his finger to his lips to tell me to be still then i saw him scribble on a piece of paper and i knew that he was writing me a note as i passed his pew on the way out i dropped my bouquet over to him and he slipped the note into my hand when he returned me the flowers it was only a line asking me to join him when he made the sign to me to do so of course i never doubted for a moment that my first duty was now to him and i determined to do just whatever he might direct when i got back i told my maid who had known him in california and had always been his friend i ordered her to say nothing but to get a few things packed and my ulster ready i know i ought to have spoken to lord st simon but it was dreadful hard before his mother and all those great people i just made up my mind to run away and explain afterwards i hadn t been at the table ten minutes before i saw frank out of the window at the other side of the road he beckoned to me and then began walking into the park i slipped out put on my things and followed him some woman came talking something or other about lord st simon to me seemed to me from the little i heard as if he had a little secret of his own before marriage also but i managed to get away from her and soon overtook frank we got into a cab together and away we drove to some lodgings he had taken in gordon square and that was my true wedding after all those years of waiting frank had been a prisoner among the apaches had escaped came on to frisco found that i had given him up for dead and had gone to england followed me there and had come upon me at last on the very morning of my second wedding i saw it in a paper explained the american it gave the name and the church but not where the lady lived then we had a talk as to what we should do and frank was all for openness but i was so ashamed of it all that i felt as if i should like to vanish away and never see any of them again just sending a line to pa perhaps to show him that i was alive it was awful to me to think of all those lords and ladies sitting round that breakfast table and waiting for me to come back so frank took my wedding clothes and things and made a bundle of them so that i should not be traced and dropped them away somewhere where no one could find them it is likely that we should have gone on to paris to morrow only that this good gentleman mr holmes came round to us this evening though how he found us is more than i can think and he showed us very clearly and kindly that i was wrong and that frank was right and that we should be putting ourselves in the wrong if we were so secret then he offered to give us a chance of talking to lord st simon alone and so we came right away round to his rooms at once now robert you have heard it all and i am very sorry if i have given you pain and i hope that you do not think very meanly of me lord st simon had by no means relaxed his rigid attitude but had listened with a frowning brow and a compressed lip to this long narrative excuse me he said but it is not my custom to discuss my most intimate personal affairs in this public manner then you won t forgive me you won t shake hands before i go oh certainly if it would give you any pleasure he put out his hand and coldly grasped that which she extended to him i had hoped suggested holmes that you would have joined us in a friendly supper i think that there you ask a little too much responded his lordship i may be forced to acquiesce in these recent developments but i can hardly be expected to make merry over them i think that with your permission i will now wish you all a very good night he included us all in a sweeping bow and stalked out of the room then i trust that you at least will honour me with your company said sherlock holmes it is always a joy to meet an american mr moulton for i am one of those who believe that the folly of a monarch and the blundering of a minister in far gone years will not prevent our children from being some day citizens of the same world wide country under a flag which shall be a quartering of the union jack with the stars and stripes the case has been an interesting one remarked holmes when our visitors had left us because it serves to show very clearly how simple the explanation may be of an affair which at first sight seems to be almost inexplicable nothing could be more natural than the sequence of events as narrated by this lady and nothing stranger than the result when viewed for instance by mr lestrade of scotland yard you were not yourself at fault at all then from the first two facts were very obvious to me the one that the lady had been quite willing to undergo the wedding ceremony the other that she had repented of it within a few minutes of returning home obviously something had occurred during the morning then to cause her to change her mind what could that something be she could not have spoken to anyone when she was out for she had been in the company of the bridegroom had she seen someone then if she had it must be someone from america because she had spent so short a time in this country that she could hardly have allowed anyone to acquire so deep an influence over her that the mere sight of him would induce her to change her plans so completely you see we have already arrived by a process of exclusion at the idea that she might have seen an american then who could this american be and why should he possess so much influence over her it might be a lover it might be a husband her young womanhood had i knew been spent in rough scenes and under strange conditions so far i had got before i ever heard lord st simon s narrative when he told us of a man in a pew of the change in the bride s manner of so transparent a device for obtaining a note as the dropping of a bouquet of her resort to her confidential maid and of her very significant allusion to claim jumping which in miners parlance means taking possession of that which another person has a prior claim to the whole situation became absolutely clear she had gone off with a man and the man was either a lover or was a previous husband the chances being in favour of the latter and how in the world did you find them it might have been difficult but friend lestrade held information in his hands the value of which he did not himself know the initials were of course of the highest importance but more valuable still was it to know that within a week he had settled his bill at one of the most select london hotels how did you deduce the select by the select prices eight shillings for a bed and eightpence for a glass of sherry pointed to one of the most expensive hotels there are not many in london which charge at that rate in the second one which i visited in northumberland avenue i learned by an inspection of the book that francis h moulton an american gentleman had left only the day before and on looking over the entries against him i came upon the very items which i had seen in the duplicate bill his letters were to be forwarded to gordon square so thither i travelled and being fortunate enough to find the loving couple at home i ventured to give them some paternal advice and to point out to them that it would be better in every way that they should make their position a little clearer both to the general public and to lord st simon in particular i invited them to meet him here and as you see i made him keep the appointment but with no very good result i remarked his conduct was certainly not very gracious ah watson said holmes smiling perhaps you would not be very gracious either if after all the trouble of wooing and wedding you found yourself deprived in an instant of wife and of fortune i think that we may judge lord st simon very mercifully and thank our stars that we are never likely to find ourselves in the same position draw your chair up and hand me my violin for the only problem we have still to solve is how to while away these bleak autumnal evenings xi the adventure of the beryl coronet holmes said i as i stood one morning in our bow window looking down the street here is a madman coming along it seems rather sad that his relatives should allow him to come out alone my friend rose lazily from his armchair and stood with his hands in the pockets of his dressing gown looking over my shoulder it was a bright crisp february morning and the snow of the day before still lay deep upon the ground shimmering brightly in the wintry sun down the centre of baker street it had been ploughed into a brown crumbly band by the traffic but at either side and on the heaped up edges of the footpaths it still lay as white as when it fell the grey pavement had been cleaned and scraped but was still dangerously slippery so that there were fewer passengers than usual indeed from the direction of the metropolitan station no one was coming save the single gentleman whose eccentric conduct had drawn my attention he was a man of about fifty tall portly and imposing with a massive strongly marked face and a commanding figure he was dressed in a sombre yet rich style in black frock coat shining hat neat brown gaiters and well cut pearl grey trousers yet his actions were in absurd contrast to the dignity of his dress and features for he was running hard with occasional little springs such as a weary man gives who is little accustomed to set any tax upon his legs as he ran he jerked his hands up and down waggled his head and writhed his face into the most extraordinary contortions what on earth can be the matter with him i asked he is looking up at the numbers of the houses i believe that he is coming here said holmes rubbing his hands here yes i rather think he is coming to consult me professionally i think that i recognise the symptoms ha did i not tell you as he spoke the man puffing and blowing rushed at our door and pulled at our bell until the whole house resounded with the clanging a few moments later he was in our room still puffing still gesticulating but with so fixed a look of grief and despair in his eyes that our smiles were turned in an instant to horror and pity for a while he could not get his words out but swayed his body and plucked at his hair like one who has been driven to the extreme limits of his reason then suddenly springing to his feet he beat his head against the wall with such force that we both rushed upon him and tore him away to the centre of the room sherlock holmes pushed him down into the easy chair and sitting beside him patted his hand and chatted with him in the easy soothing tones which he knew so well how to employ you have come to me to tell your story have you not said he you are fatigued with your haste pray wait until you have recovered yourself and then i shall be most happy to look into any little problem which you may submit to me the man sat for a minute or more with a heaving chest fighting against his emotion then he passed his handkerchief over his brow set his lips tight and turned his face towards us no doubt you think me mad said he i see that you have had some great trouble responded holmes god knows i have a trouble which is enough to unseat my reason so sudden and so terrible is it public disgrace i might have faced although i am a man whose character has never yet borne a stain private affliction also is the lot of every man but the two coming together and in so frightful a form have been enough to shake my very soul besides it is not i alone the very noblest in the land may suffer unless some way be found out of this horrible affair pray compose yourself sir said holmes and let me have a clear account of who you are and what it is that has befallen you my name answered our visitor is probably familiar to your ears i am alexander holder of the banking firm of holder stevenson of threadneedle street the name was indeed well known to us as belonging to the senior partner in the second largest private banking concern in the city of london what could have happened then to bring one of the foremost citizens of london to this most pitiable pass we waited all curiosity until with another effort he braced himself to tell his story i feel that time is of value said he that is why i hastened here when the police inspector suggested that i should secure your co operation i came to baker street by the underground and hurried from there on foot for the cabs go slowly through this snow that is why i was so out of breath for i am a man who takes very little exercise i feel better now and i will put the facts before you as shortly and yet as clearly as i can it is of course well known to you that in a successful banking business as much depends upon our being able to find remunerative investments for our funds as upon our increasing our connection and the number of our depositors one of our most lucrative means of laying out money is in the shape of loans where the security is unimpeachable we have done a good deal in this direction during the last few years and there are many noble families to whom we have advanced large sums upon the security of their pictures libraries or plate yesterday morning i was seated in my office at the bank when a card was brought in to me by one of the clerks i started when i saw the name for it was that of none other than well perhaps even to you i had better say no more than that it was a name which is a household word all over the earth one of the highest noblest most exalted names in england i was overwhelmed by the honour and attempted when he entered to say so but he plunged at once into business with the air of a man who wishes to hurry quickly through a disagreeable task mr holder said he i have been informed that you are in the habit of advancing money the firm does so when the security is good i answered it is absolutely essential to me said he that i should have at once i could of course borrow so trifling a sum ten times over from my friends but i much prefer to make it a matter of business and to carry out that business myself in my position you can readily understand that it is unwise to place one s self under obligations for how long may i ask do you want this sum i asked next monday i have a large sum due to me and i shall then most certainly repay what you advance with whatever interest you think it right to charge but it is very essential to me that the money should be paid at once i should be happy to advance it without further parley from my own private purse said i were it not that the strain would be rather more than it could bear if on the other hand i am to do it in the name of the firm then in justice to my partner i must insist that even in your case every businesslike precaution should be taken i should much prefer to have it so said he raising up a square black morocco case which he had laid beside his chair you have doubtless heard of the beryl coronet one of the most precious public possessions of the empire said i precisely he opened the case and there imbedded in soft flesh coloured velvet lay the magnificent piece of jewellery which he had named there are thirty nine enormous beryls said he and the price of the gold chasing is incalculable the lowest estimate would put the worth of the coronet at double the sum which i have asked i am prepared to leave it with you as my security i took the precious case into my hands and looked in some perplexity from it to my illustrious client you doubt its value he asked not at all i only doubt the propriety of my leaving it you may set your mind at rest about that i should not dream of doing so were it not absolutely certain that i should be able in four days to reclaim it it is a pure matter of form is the security sufficient ample you understand mr holder that i am giving you a strong proof of the confidence which i have in you founded upon all that i have heard of you i rely upon you not only to be discreet and to refrain from all gossip upon the matter but above all to preserve this coronet with every possible precaution because i need not say that a great public scandal would be caused if any harm were to befall it any injury to it would be almost as serious as its complete loss for there are no beryls in the world to match these and it would be impossible to replace them i leave it with you however with every confidence and i shall call for it in person on monday morning seeing that my client was anxious to leave i said no more but calling for my cashier i ordered him to pay over fifty notes when i was alone once more however with the precious case lying upon the table in front of me i could not but think with some misgivings of the immense responsibility which it entailed upon me there could be no doubt that as it was a national possession a horrible scandal would ensue if any misfortune should occur to it i already regretted having ever consented to take charge of it however it was too late to alter the matter now so i locked it up in my private safe and turned once more to my work when evening came i felt that it would be an imprudence to leave so precious a thing in the office behind me bankers safes had been forced before now and why should not mine be if so how terrible would be the position in which i should find myself i determined therefore that for the next few days i would always carry the case backward and forward with me so that it might never be really out of my reach with this intention i called a cab and drove out to my house at streatham carrying the jewel with me i did not breathe freely until i had taken it upstairs and locked it in the bureau of my dressing room and now a word as to my household mr holmes for i wish you to thoroughly understand the situation my groom and my page sleep out of the house and may be set aside altogether i have three maid servants who have been with me a number of years and whose absolute reliability is quite above suspicion another lucy parr the second waiting maid has only been in my service a few months she came with an excellent character however and has always given me satisfaction she is a very pretty girl and has attracted admirers who have occasionally hung about the place that is the only drawback which we have found to her but we believe her to be a thoroughly good girl in every way so much for the servants my family itself is so small that it will not take me long to describe it i am a widower and have an only son arthur he has been a disappointment to me mr holmes a grievous disappointment i have no doubt that i am myself to blame people tell me that i have spoiled him very likely i have when my dear wife died i felt that he was all i had to love i could not bear to see the smile fade even for a moment from his face i have never denied him a wish perhaps it would have been better for both of us had i been sterner but i meant it for the best it was naturally my intention that he should succeed me in my business but he was not of a business turn he was wild wayward and to speak the truth i could not trust him in the handling of large sums of money when he was young he became a member of an aristocratic club and there having charming manners he was soon the intimate of a number of men with long purses and expensive habits he learned to play heavily at cards and to squander money on the turf until he had again and again to come to me and implore me to give him an advance upon his allowance that he might settle his debts of honour he tried more than once to break away from the dangerous company which he was keeping but each time the influence of his friend sir george burnwell was enough to draw him back again and indeed i could not wonder that such a man as sir george burnwell should gain an influence over him for he has frequently brought him to my house and i have found myself that i could hardly resist the fascination of his manner he is older than arthur a man of the world to his finger tips one who had been everywhere seen everything a brilliant talker and a man of great personal beauty yet when i think of him in cold blood far away from the glamour of his presence i am convinced from his cynical speech and the look which i have caught in his eyes that he is one who should be deeply distrusted so i think and so too thinks my little mary who has a woman s quick insight into character and now there is only she to be described she is my niece but when my brother died five years ago and left her alone in the world i adopted her and have looked upon her ever since as my daughter she is a sunbeam in my house sweet loving beautiful a wonderful manager and housekeeper yet as tender and quiet and gentle as a woman could be she is my right hand i do not know what i could do without her in only one matter has she ever gone against my wishes twice my boy has asked her to marry him for he loves her devotedly but each time she has refused him i think that if anyone could have drawn him into the right path it would have been she and that his marriage might have changed his whole life but now alas it is too late forever too late now mr holmes you know the people who live under my roof and i shall continue with my miserable story when we were taking coffee in the drawing room that night after dinner i told arthur and mary my experience and of the precious treasure which we had under our roof suppressing only the name of my client lucy parr who had brought in the coffee had i am sure left the room but i cannot swear that the door was closed mary and arthur were much interested and wished to see the famous coronet but i thought it better not to disturb it where have you put it asked arthur in my own bureau well i hope to goodness the house won t be burgled during the night said he it is locked up i answered oh any old key will fit that bureau when i was a youngster i have opened it myself with the key of the box room cupboard he often had a wild way of talking so that i thought little of what he said he followed me to my room however that night with a very grave face look here dad said he with his eyes cast down can you let me have no i cannot i answered sharply i have been far too generous with you in money matters you have been very kind said he but i must have this money or else i can never show my face inside the club again and a very good thing too i cried yes but you would not have me leave it a dishonoured man said he i could not bear the disgrace i must raise the money in some way and if you will not let me have it then i must try other means i was very angry for this was the third demand during the month you shall not have a farthing from me i cried on which he bowed and left the room without another word when he was gone i unlocked my bureau made sure that my treasure was safe and locked it again then i started to go round the house to see that all was secure a duty which i usually leave to mary but which i thought it well to perform myself that night as i came down the stairs i saw mary herself at the side window of the hall which she closed and fastened as i approached tell me dad said she looking i thought a little disturbed did you give lucy the maid leave to go out to night certainly not she came in just now by the back door i have no doubt that she has only been to the side gate to see someone but i think that it is hardly safe and should be stopped you must speak to her in the morning or i will if you prefer it are you sure that everything is fastened quite sure dad then good night i kissed her and went up to my bedroom again where i was soon asleep i am endeavouring to tell you everything mr holmes which may have any bearing upon the case but i beg that you will question me upon any point which i do not make clear on the contrary your statement is singularly lucid i come to a part of my story now in which i should wish to be particularly so i am not a very heavy sleeper and the anxiety in my mind tended no doubt to make me even less so than usual about two in the morning then i was awakened by some sound in the house it had ceased ere i was wide awake but it had left an impression behind it as though a window had gently closed somewhere i lay listening with all my ears suddenly to my horror there was a distinct sound of footsteps moving softly in the next room i slipped out of bed all palpitating with fear and peeped round the corner of my dressing room door arthur i screamed you villain you thief how dare you touch that coronet the gas was half up as i had left it and my unhappy boy dressed only in his shirt and trousers was standing beside the light holding the coronet in his hands he appeared to be wrenching at it or bending it with all his strength at my cry he dropped it from his grasp and turned as pale as death i snatched it up and examined it one of the gold corners with three of the beryls in it was missing you blackguard i shouted beside myself with rage you have destroyed it you have dishonoured me forever where are the jewels which you have stolen stolen he cried yes thief i roared shaking him by the shoulder there are none missing there cannot be any missing said he there are three missing and you know where they are must i call you a liar as well as a thief did i not see you trying to tear off another piece you have called me names enough said he i will not stand it any longer i shall not say another word about this business since you have chosen to insult me i will leave your house in the morning and make my own way in the world you shall leave it in the hands of the police i cried half mad with grief and rage i shall have this matter probed to the bottom you shall learn nothing from me said he with a passion such as i should not have thought was in his nature if you choose to call the police let the police find what they can by this time the whole house was astir for i had raised my voice in my anger mary was the first to rush into my room and at the sight of the coronet and of arthur s face she read the whole story and with a scream fell down senseless on the ground i sent the housemaid for the police and put the investigation into their hands at once when the inspector and a constable entered the house arthur who had stood sullenly with his arms folded asked me whether it was my intention to charge him with theft i answered that it had ceased to be a private matter but had become a public one since the ruined coronet was national property i was determined that the law should have its way in everything at least said he you will not have me arrested at once it would be to your advantage as well as mine if i might leave the house for five minutes that you may get away or perhaps that you may conceal what you have stolen said i and then realising the dreadful position in which i was placed i implored him to remember that not only my honour but that of one who was far greater than i was at stake and that he threatened to raise a scandal which would convulse the nation he might avert it all if he would but tell me what he had done with the three missing stones you may as well face the matter said i you have been caught in the act and no confession could make your guilt more heinous if you but make such reparation as is in your power by telling us where the beryls are all shall be forgiven and forgotten keep your forgiveness for those who ask for it he answered turning away from me with a sneer i saw that he was too hardened for any words of mine to influence him there was but one way for it i called in the inspector and gave him into custody a search was made at once not only of his person but of his room and of every portion of the house where he could possibly have concealed the gems but no trace of them could be found nor would the wretched boy open his mouth for all our persuasions and our threats this morning he was removed to a cell and i after going through all the police formalities have hurried round to you to implore you to use your skill in unravelling the matter the police have openly confessed that they can at present make nothing of it you may go to any expense which you think necessary i have already offered a reward of my god what shall i do i have lost my honour my gems and my son in one night oh what shall i do he put a hand on either side of his head and rocked himself to and fro droning to himself like a child whose grief has got beyond words sherlock holmes sat silent for some few minutes with his brows knitted and his eyes fixed upon the fire do you receive much company he asked none save my partner with his family and an occasional friend of arthur s sir george burnwell has been several times lately no one else i think do you go out much in society arthur does mary and i stay at home we neither of us care for it that is unusual in a young girl she is of a quiet nature besides she is not so very young she is four and twenty this matter from what you say seems to have been a shock to her also terrible she is even more affected than i you have neither of you any doubt as to your son s guilt how can we have when i saw him with my own eyes with the coronet in his hands i hardly consider that a conclusive proof was the remainder of the coronet at all injured yes it was twisted do you not think then that he might have been trying to straighten it god bless you you are doing what you can for him and for me but it is too heavy a task what was he doing there at all if his purpose were innocent why did he not say so precisely and if it were guilty why did he not invent a lie his silence appears to me to cut both ways there are several singular points about the case what did the police think of the noise which awoke you from your sleep they considered that it might be caused by arthur s closing his bedroom door a likely story as if a man bent on felony would slam his door so as to wake a household what did they say then of the disappearance of these gems they are still sounding the planking and probing the furniture in the hope of finding them have they thought of looking outside the house yes they have shown extraordinary energy the whole garden has already been minutely examined now my dear sir said holmes is it not obvious to you now that this matter really strikes very much deeper than either you or the police were at first inclined to think it appeared to you to be a simple case to me it seems exceedingly complex consider what is involved by your theory you suppose that your son came down from his bed went at great risk to your dressing room opened your bureau took out your coronet broke off by main force a small portion of it went off to some other place concealed three gems out of the thirty nine with such skill that nobody can find them and then returned with the other thirty six into the room in which he exposed himself to the greatest danger of being discovered i ask you now is such a theory tenable but what other is there cried the banker with a gesture of despair if his motives were innocent why does he not explain them it is our task to find that out replied holmes so now if you please mr holder we will set off for streatham together and devote an hour to glancing a little more closely into details my friend insisted upon my accompanying them in their expedition which i was eager enough to do for my curiosity and sympathy were deeply stirred by the story to which we had listened i confess that the guilt of the banker s son appeared to me to be as obvious as it did to his unhappy father but still i had such faith in holmes judgment that i felt that there must be some grounds for hope as long as he was dissatisfied with the accepted explanation he hardly spoke a word the whole way out to the southern suburb but sat with his chin upon his breast and his hat drawn over his eyes sunk in the deepest thought our client appeared to have taken fresh heart at the little glimpse of hope which had been presented to him and he even broke into a desultory chat with me over his business affairs a short railway journey and a shorter walk brought us to fairbank the modest residence of the great financier fairbank was a good sized square house of white stone standing back a little from the road a double carriage sweep with a snow clad lawn stretched down in front to two large iron gates which closed the entrance on the right side was a small wooden thicket which led into a narrow path between two neat hedges stretching from the road to the kitchen door and forming the tradesmen s entrance on the left ran a lane which led to the stables and was not itself within the grounds at all being a public though little used thoroughfare holmes left us standing at the door and walked slowly all round the house across the front down the tradesmen s path and so round by the garden behind into the stable lane so long was he that mr holder and i went into the dining room and waited by the fire until he should return we were sitting there in silence when the door opened and a young lady came in she was rather above the middle height slim with dark hair and eyes which seemed the darker against the absolute pallor of her skin i do not think that i have ever seen such deadly paleness in a woman s face her lips too were bloodless but her eyes were flushed with crying as she swept silently into the room she impressed me with a greater sense of grief than the banker had done in the morning and it was the more striking in her as she was evidently a woman of strong character with immense capacity for self restraint disregarding my presence she went straight to her uncle and passed her hand over his head with a sweet womanly caress you have given orders that arthur should be liberated have you not dad she asked no no my girl the matter must be probed to the bottom but i am so sure that he is innocent you know what woman s instincts are i know that he has done no harm and that you will be sorry for having acted so harshly why is he silent then if he is innocent who knows perhaps because he was so angry that you should suspect him how could i help suspecting him when i actually saw him with the coronet in his hand oh but he had only picked it up to look at it oh do do take my word for it that he is innocent let the matter drop and say no more it is so dreadful to think of our dear arthur in prison i shall never let it drop until the gems are found never mary your affection for arthur blinds you as to the awful consequences to me far from hushing the thing up i have brought a gentleman down from london to inquire more deeply into it this gentleman she asked facing round to me no his friend he wished us to leave him alone he is round in the stable lane now the stable lane she raised her dark eyebrows what can he hope to find there ah this i suppose is he i trust sir that you will succeed in proving what i feel sure is the truth that my cousin arthur is innocent of this crime i fully share your opinion and i trust with you that we may prove it returned holmes going back to the mat to knock the snow from his shoes i believe i have the honour of addressing miss mary holder might i ask you a question or two pray do sir if it may help to clear this horrible affair up you heard nothing yourself last night nothing until my uncle here began to speak loudly i heard that and i came down you shut up the windows and doors the night before did you fasten all the windows yes were they all fastened this morning yes you have a maid who has a sweetheart i think that you remarked to your uncle last night that she had been out to see him yes and she was the girl who waited in the drawing room and who may have heard uncle s remarks about the coronet i see you infer that she may have gone out to tell her sweetheart and that the two may have planned the robbery but what is the good of all these vague theories cried the banker impatiently when i have told you that i saw arthur with the coronet in his hands wait a little mr holder we must come back to that about this girl miss holder you saw her return by the kitchen door i presume yes when i went to see if the door was fastened for the night i met her slipping in i saw the man too in the gloom do you know him oh yes he is the greengrocer who brings our vegetables round his name is francis prosper he stood said holmes to the left of the door that is to say farther up the path than is necessary to reach the door yes he did and he is a man with a wooden leg something like fear sprang up in the young lady s expressive black eyes why you are like a magician said she how do you know that she smiled but there was no answering smile in holmes thin eager face i should be very glad now to go upstairs said he i shall probably wish to go over the outside of the house again perhaps i had better take a look at the lower windows before i go up he walked swiftly round from one to the other pausing only at the large one which looked from the hall onto the stable lane this he opened and made a very careful examination of the sill with his powerful magnifying lens now we shall go upstairs said he at last the banker s dressing room was a plainly furnished little chamber with a grey carpet a large bureau and a long mirror holmes went to the bureau first and looked hard at the lock which key was used to open it he asked that which my son himself indicated that of the cupboard of the lumber room have you it here that is it on the dressing table sherlock holmes took it up and opened the bureau it is a noiseless lock said he it is no wonder that it did not wake you this case i presume contains the coronet we must have a look at it he opened the case and taking out the diadem he laid it upon the table it was a magnificent specimen of the jeweller s art and the thirty six stones were the finest that i have ever seen at one side of the coronet was a cracked edge where a corner holding three gems had been torn away now mr holder said holmes here is the corner which corresponds to that which has been so unfortunately lost might i beg that you will break it off the banker recoiled in horror i should not dream of trying said he then i will holmes suddenly bent his strength upon it but without result i feel it give a little said he but though i am exceptionally strong in the fingers it would take me all my time to break it an ordinary man could not do it now what do you think would happen if i did break it mr holder there would be a noise like a pistol shot do you tell me that all this happened within a few yards of your bed and that you heard nothing of it i do not know what to think it is all dark to me but perhaps it may grow lighter as we go what do you think miss holder i confess that i still share my uncle s perplexity your son had no shoes or slippers on when you saw him he had nothing on save only his trousers and shirt thank you we have certainly been favoured with extraordinary luck during this inquiry and it will be entirely our own fault if we do not succeed in clearing the matter up with your permission mr holder i shall now continue my investigations outside he went alone at his own request for he explained that any unnecessary footmarks might make his task more difficult for an hour or more he was at work returning at last with his feet heavy with snow and his features as inscrutable as ever i think that i have seen now all that there is to see mr holder said he i can serve you best by returning to my rooms but the gems mr holmes where are they i cannot tell the banker wrung his hands i shall never see them again he cried and my son you give me hopes my opinion is in no way altered then for god s sake what was this dark business which was acted in my house last night if you can call upon me at my baker street rooms to morrow morning between nine and ten i shall be happy to do what i can to make it clearer i understand that you give me carte blanche to act for you provided only that i get back the gems and that you place no limit on the sum i may draw i would give my fortune to have them back very good i shall look into the matter between this and then good bye it is just possible that i may have to come over here again before evening it was obvious to me that my companion s mind was now made up about the case although what his conclusions were was more than i could even dimly imagine several times during our homeward journey i endeavoured to sound him upon the point but he always glided away to some other topic until at last i gave it over in despair it was not yet three when we found ourselves in our rooms once more he hurried to his chamber and was down again in a few minutes dressed as a common loafer with his collar turned up his shiny seedy coat his red cravat and his worn boots he was a perfect sample of the class i think that this should do said he glancing into the glass above the fireplace i only wish that you could come with me watson but i fear that it won t do i may be on the trail in this matter or i may be following a will o the wisp but i shall soon know which it is i hope that i may be back in a few hours he cut a slice of beef from the joint upon the sideboard sandwiched it between two rounds of bread and thrusting this rude meal into his pocket he started off upon his expedition i had just finished my tea when he returned evidently in excellent spirits swinging an old elastic sided boot in his hand he chucked it down into a corner and helped himself to a cup of tea i only looked in as i passed said he i am going right on where to oh to the other side of the west end it may be some time before i get back don t wait up for me in case i should be late how are you getting on oh so so nothing to complain of i have been out to streatham since i saw you last but i did not call at the house it is a very sweet little problem and i would not have missed it for a good deal however i must not sit gossiping here but must get these disreputable clothes off and return to my highly respectable self i could see by his manner that he had stronger reasons for satisfaction than his words alone would imply his eyes twinkled and there was even a touch of colour upon his sallow cheeks he hastened upstairs and a few minutes later i heard the slam of the hall door which told me that he was off once more upon his congenial hunt i waited until midnight but there was no sign of his return so i retired to my room it was no uncommon thing for him to be away for days and nights on end when he was hot upon a scent so that his lateness caused me no surprise i do not know at what hour he came in but when i came down to breakfast in the morning there he was with a cup of coffee in one hand and the paper in the other as fresh and trim as possible you will excuse my beginning without you watson said he but you remember that our client has rather an early appointment this morning why it is after nine now i answered i should not be surprised if that were he i thought i heard a ring it was indeed our friend the financier i was shocked by the change which had come over him for his face which was naturally of a broad and massive mould was now pinched and fallen in while his hair seemed to me at least a shade whiter he entered with a weariness and lethargy which was even more painful than his violence of the morning before and he dropped heavily into the armchair which i pushed forward for him i do not know what i have done to be so severely tried said he only two days ago i was a happy and prosperous man without a care in the world now i am left to a lonely and dishonoured age one sorrow comes close upon the heels of another my niece mary has deserted me deserted you yes her bed this morning had not been slept in her room was empty and a note for me lay upon the hall table i had said to her last night in sorrow and not in anger that if she had married my boy all might have been well with him perhaps it was thoughtless of me to say so it is to that remark that she refers in this note my dearest uncle i feel that i have brought trouble upon you and that if i had acted differently this terrible misfortune might never have occurred i cannot with this thought in my mind ever again be happy under your roof and i feel that i must leave you forever do not worry about my future for that is provided for and above all do not search for me for it will be fruitless labour and an ill service to me in life or in death i am ever your loving mary what could she mean by that note mr holmes do you think it points to suicide no no nothing of the kind it is perhaps the best possible solution i trust mr holder that you are nearing the end of your troubles ha you say so you have heard something mr holmes you have learned something where are the gems you would not think apiece an excessive sum for them i would pay ten that would be unnecessary three thousand will cover the matter and there is a little reward i fancy have you your cheque book here is a pen better make it out for with a dazed face the banker made out the required check holmes walked over to his desk took out a little triangular piece of gold with three gems in it and threw it down upon the table with a shriek of joy our client clutched it up you have it he gasped i am saved i am saved the reaction of joy was as passionate as his grief had been and he hugged his recovered gems to his bosom there is one other thing you owe mr holder said sherlock holmes rather sternly owe he caught up a pen name the sum and i will pay it no the debt is not to me you owe a very humble apology to that noble lad your son who has carried himself in this matter as i should be proud to see my own son do should i ever chance to have one then it was not arthur who took them i told you yesterday and i repeat to day that it was not you are sure of it then let us hurry to him at once to let him know that the truth is known he knows it already when i had cleared it all up i had an interview with him and finding that he would not tell me the story i told it to him on which he had to confess that i was right and to add the very few details which were not yet quite clear to me your news of this morning however may open his lips for heaven s sake tell me then what is this extraordinary mystery i will do so and i will show you the steps by which i reached it and let me say to you first that which it is hardest for me to say and for you to hear there has been an understanding between sir george burnwell and your niece mary they have now fled together my mary impossible it is unfortunately more than possible it is certain neither you nor your son knew the true character of this man when you admitted him into your family circle he is one of the most dangerous men in england a ruined gambler an absolutely desperate villain a man without heart or conscience your niece knew nothing of such men when he breathed his vows to her as he had done to a hundred before her she flattered herself that she alone had touched his heart the devil knows best what he said but at least she became his tool and was in the habit of seeing him nearly every evening i cannot and i will not believe it cried the banker with an ashen face i will tell you then what occurred in your house last night your niece when you had as she thought gone to your room slipped down and talked to her lover through the window which leads into the stable lane his footmarks had pressed right through the snow so long had he stood there she told him of the coronet his wicked lust for gold kindled at the news and he bent her to his will i have no doubt that she loved you but there are women in whom the love of a lover extinguishes all other loves and i think that she must have been one she had hardly listened to his instructions when she saw you coming downstairs on which she closed the window rapidly and told you about one of the servants escapade with her wooden legged lover which was all perfectly true your boy arthur went to bed after his interview with you but he slept badly on account of his uneasiness about his club debts in the middle of the night he heard a soft tread pass his door so he rose and looking out was surprised to see his cousin walking very stealthily along the passage until she disappeared into your dressing room petrified with astonishment the lad slipped on some clothes and waited there in the dark to see what would come of this strange affair presently she emerged from the room again and in the light of the passage lamp your son saw that she carried the precious coronet in her hands she passed down the stairs and he thrilling with horror ran along and slipped behind the curtain near your door whence he could see what passed in the hall beneath he saw her stealthily open the window hand out the coronet to someone in the gloom and then closing it once more hurry back to her room passing quite close to where he stood hid behind the curtain as long as she was on the scene he could not take any action without a horrible exposure of the woman whom he loved but the instant that she was gone he realised how crushing a misfortune this would be for you and how all important it was to set it right he rushed down just as he was in his bare feet opened the window sprang out into the snow and ran down the lane where he could see a dark figure in the moonlight sir george burnwell tried to get away but arthur caught him and there was a struggle between them your lad tugging at one side of the coronet and his opponent at the other in the scuffle your son struck sir george and cut him over the eye then something suddenly snapped and your son finding that he had the coronet in his hands rushed back closed the window ascended to your room and had just observed that the coronet had been twisted in the struggle and was endeavouring to straighten it when you appeared upon the scene is it possible gasped the banker you then roused his anger by calling him names at a moment when he felt that he had deserved your warmest thanks he could not explain the true state of affairs without betraying one who certainly deserved little enough consideration at his hands he took the more chivalrous view however and preserved her secret and that was why she shrieked and fainted when she saw the coronet cried mr holder oh my god what a blind fool i have been and his asking to be allowed to go out for five minutes the dear fellow wanted to see if the missing piece were at the scene of the struggle how cruelly i have misjudged him when i arrived at the house continued holmes i at once went very carefully round it to observe if there were any traces in the snow which might help me i knew that none had fallen since the evening before and also that there had been a strong frost to preserve impressions i passed along the tradesmen s path but found it all trampled down and indistinguishable just beyond it however at the far side of the kitchen door a woman had stood and talked with a man whose round impressions on one side showed that he had a wooden leg i could even tell that they had been disturbed for the woman had run back swiftly to the door as was shown by the deep toe and light heel marks while wooden leg had waited a little and then had gone away i thought at the time that this might be the maid and her sweetheart of whom you had already spoken to me and inquiry showed it was so i passed round the garden without seeing anything more than random tracks which i took to be the police but when i got into the stable lane a very long and complex story was written in the snow in front of me there was a double line of tracks of a booted man and a second double line which i saw with delight belonged to a man with naked feet i was at once convinced from what you had told me that the latter was your son the first had walked both ways but the other had run swiftly and as his tread was marked in places over the depression of the boot it was obvious that he had passed after the other i followed them up and found they led to the hall window where boots had worn all the snow away while waiting then i walked to the other end which was a hundred yards or more down the lane i saw where boots had faced round where the snow was cut up as though there had been a struggle and finally where a few drops of blood had fallen to show me that i was not mistaken boots had then run down the lane and another little smudge of blood showed that it was he who had been hurt when he came to the high road at the other end i found that the pavement had been cleared so there was an end to that clue on entering the house however i examined as you remember the sill and framework of the hall window with my lens and i could at once see that someone had passed out i could distinguish the outline of an instep where the wet foot had been placed in coming in i was then beginning to be able to form an opinion as to what had occurred a man had waited outside the window someone had brought the gems the deed had been overseen by your son he had pursued the thief had struggled with him they had each tugged at the coronet their united strength causing injuries which neither alone could have effected he had returned with the prize but had left a fragment in the grasp of his opponent so far i was clear the question now was who was the man and who was it brought him the coronet it is an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded the impossible whatever remains however improbable must be the truth now i knew that it was not you who had brought it down so there only remained your niece and the maids but if it were the maids why should your son allow himself to be accused in their place there could be no possible reason as he loved his cousin however there was an excellent explanation why he should retain her secret the more so as the secret was a disgraceful one when i remembered that you had seen her at that window and how she had fainted on seeing the coronet again my conjecture became a certainty and who could it be who was her confederate a lover evidently for who else could outweigh the love and gratitude which she must feel to you i knew that you went out little and that your circle of friends was a very limited one but among them was sir george burnwell i had heard of him before as being a man of evil reputation among women it must have been he who wore those boots and retained the missing gems even though he knew that arthur had discovered him he might still flatter himself that he was safe for the lad could not say a word without compromising his own family well your own good sense will suggest what measures i took next i went in the shape of a loafer to sir george s house managed to pick up an acquaintance with his valet learned that his master had cut his head the night before and finally at the expense of six shillings made all sure by buying a pair of his cast off shoes with these i journeyed down to streatham and saw that they exactly fitted the tracks i saw an ill dressed vagabond in the lane yesterday evening said mr holder precisely it was i i found that i had my man so i came home and changed my clothes it was a delicate part which i had to play then for i saw that a prosecution must be avoided to avert scandal and i knew that so astute a villain would see that our hands were tied in the matter i went and saw him at first of course he denied everything but when i gave him every particular that had occurred he tried to bluster and took down a life preserver from the wall i knew my man however and i clapped a pistol to his head before he could strike then he became a little more reasonable i told him that we would give him a price for the stones he held apiece that brought out the first signs of grief that he had shown why dash it all said he i ve let them go at six hundred for the three i soon managed to get the address of the receiver who had them on promising him that there would be no prosecution off i set to him and after much chaffering i got our stones at apiece then i looked in upon your son told him that all was right and eventually got to my bed about two o clock after what i may call a really hard day s work a day which has saved england from a great public scandal said the banker rising sir i cannot find words to thank you but you shall not find me ungrateful for what you have done your skill has indeed exceeded all that i have heard of it and now i must fly to my dear boy to apologise to him for the wrong which i have done him as to what you tell me of poor mary it goes to my very heart not even your skill can inform me where she is now i think that we may safely say returned holmes that she is wherever sir george burnwell is it is equally certain too that whatever her sins are they will soon receive a more than sufficient punishment xii the adventure of the copper beeches to the man who loves art for its own sake remarked sherlock holmes tossing aside the advertisement sheet of the daily telegraph it is frequently in its least important and lowliest manifestations that the keenest pleasure is to be derived it is pleasant to me to observe watson that you have so far grasped this truth that in these little records of our cases which you have been good enough to draw up and i am bound to say occasionally to embellish you have given prominence not so much to the many causes c l bres and sensational trials in which i have figured but rather to those incidents which may have been trivial in themselves but which have given room for those faculties of deduction and of logical synthesis which i have made my special province and yet said i smiling i cannot quite hold myself absolved from the charge of sensationalism which has been urged against my records you have erred perhaps he observed taking up a glowing cinder with the tongs and lighting with it the long cherry wood pipe which was wont to replace his clay when he was in a disputatious rather than a meditative mood you have erred perhaps in attempting to put colour and life into each of your statements instead of confining yourself to the task of placing upon record that severe reasoning from cause to effect which is really the only notable feature about the thing it seems to me that i have done you full justice in the matter i remarked with some coldness for i was repelled by the egotism which i had more than once observed to be a strong factor in my friend s singular character no it is not selfishness or conceit said he answering as was his wont my thoughts rather than my words if i claim full justice for my art it is because it is an impersonal thing a thing beyond myself crime is common logic is rare therefore it is upon the logic rather than upon the crime that you should dwell you have degraded what should have been a course of lectures into a series of tales it was a cold morning of the early spring and we sat after breakfast on either side of a cheery fire in the old room at baker street a thick fog rolled down between the lines of dun coloured houses and the opposing windows loomed like dark shapeless blurs through the heavy yellow wreaths our gas was lit and shone on the white cloth and glimmer of china and metal for the table had not been cleared yet sherlock holmes had been silent all the morning dipping continuously into the advertisement columns of a succession of papers until at last having apparently given up his search he had emerged in no very sweet temper to lecture me upon my literary shortcomings at the same time he remarked after a pause during which he had sat puffing at his long pipe and gazing down into the fire you can hardly be open to a charge of sensationalism for out of these cases which you have been so kind as to interest yourself in a fair proportion do not treat of crime in its legal sense at all the small matter in which i endeavoured to help the king of bohemia the singular experience of miss mary sutherland the problem connected with the man with the twisted lip and the incident of the noble bachelor were all matters which are outside the pale of the law but in avoiding the sensational i fear that you may have bordered on the trivial the end may have been so i answered but the methods i hold to have been novel and of interest pshaw my dear fellow what do the public the great unobservant public who could hardly tell a weaver by his tooth or a compositor by his left thumb care about the finer shades of analysis and deduction but indeed if you are trivial i cannot blame you for the days of the great cases are past man or at least criminal man has lost all enterprise and originality as to my own little practice it seems to be degenerating into an agency for recovering lost lead pencils and giving advice to young ladies from boarding schools i think that i have touched bottom at last however this note i had this morning marks my zero point i fancy read it he tossed a crumpled letter across to me it was dated from montague place upon the preceding evening and ran thus dear mr holmes i am very anxious to consult you as to whether i should or should not accept a situation which has been offered to me as governess i shall call at half past ten to morrow if i do not inconvenience you yours faithfully violet hunter do you know the young lady i asked not i it is half past ten now yes and i have no doubt that is her ring it may turn out to be of more interest than you think you remember that the affair of the blue carbuncle which appeared to be a mere whim at first developed into a serious investigation it may be so in this case also well let us hope so but our doubts will very soon be solved for here unless i am much mistaken is the person in question as he spoke the door opened and a young lady entered the room she was plainly but neatly dressed with a bright quick face freckled like a plover s egg and with the brisk manner of a woman who has had her own way to make in the world you will excuse my troubling you i am sure said she as my companion rose to greet her but i have had a very strange experience and as i have no parents or relations of any sort from whom i could ask advice i thought that perhaps you would be kind enough to tell me what i should do pray take a seat miss hunter i shall be happy to do anything that i can to serve you i could see that holmes was favourably impressed by the manner and speech of his new client he looked her over in his searching fashion and then composed himself with his lids drooping and his finger tips together to listen to her story i have been a governess for five years said she in the family of colonel spence munro but two months ago the colonel received an appointment at halifax in nova scotia and took his children over to america with him so that i found myself without a situation i advertised and i answered advertisements but without success at last the little money which i had saved began to run short and i was at my wit s end as to what i should do there is a well known agency for governesses in the west end called westaway s and there i used to call about once a week in order to see whether anything had turned up which might suit me westaway was the name of the founder of the business but it is really managed by miss stoper she sits in her own little office and the ladies who are seeking employment wait in an anteroom and are then shown in one by one when she consults her ledgers and sees whether she has anything which would suit them well when i called last week i was shown into the little office as usual but i found that miss stoper was not alone a prodigiously stout man with a very smiling face and a great heavy chin which rolled down in fold upon fold over his throat sat at her elbow with a pair of glasses on his nose looking very earnestly at the ladies who entered as i came in he gave quite a jump in his chair and turned quickly to miss stoper that will do said he i could not ask for anything better capital capital he seemed quite enthusiastic and rubbed his hands together in the most genial fashion he was such a comfortable looking man that it was quite a pleasure to look at him you are looking for a situation miss he asked yes sir as governess yes sir and what salary do you ask i had a month in my last place with colonel spence munro oh tut tut sweating rank sweating he cried throwing his fat hands out into the air like a man who is in a boiling passion how could anyone offer so pitiful a sum to a lady with such attractions and accomplishments my accomplishments sir may be less than you imagine said i a little french a little german music and drawing tut tut he cried this is all quite beside the question the point is have you or have you not the bearing and deportment of a lady there it is in a nutshell if you have not you are not fitted for the rearing of a child who may some day play a considerable part in the history of the country but if you have why then how could any gentleman ask you to condescend to accept anything under the three figures your salary with me madam would commence at a year you may imagine mr holmes that to me destitute as i was such an offer seemed almost too good to be true the gentleman however seeing perhaps the look of incredulity upon my face opened a pocket book and took out a note it is also my custom said he smiling in the most pleasant fashion until his eyes were just two little shining slits amid the white creases of his face to advance to my young ladies half their salary beforehand so that they may meet any little expenses of their journey and their wardrobe it seemed to me that i had never met so fascinating and so thoughtful a man as i was already in debt to my tradesmen the advance was a great convenience and yet there was something unnatural about the whole transaction which made me wish to know a little more before i quite committed myself may i ask where you live sir said i hampshire charming rural place the copper beeches five miles on the far side of winchester it is the most lovely country my dear young lady and the dearest old country house and my duties sir i should be glad to know what they would be one child one dear little romper just six years old oh if you could see him killing cockroaches with a slipper smack smack smack three gone before you could wink he leaned back in his chair and laughed his eyes into his head again i was a little startled at the nature of the child s amusement but the father s laughter made me think that perhaps he was joking my sole duties then i asked are to take charge of a single child no no not the sole not the sole my dear young lady he cried your duty would be as i am sure your good sense would suggest to obey any little commands my wife might give provided always that they were such commands as a lady might with propriety obey you see no difficulty heh i should be happy to make myself useful quite so in dress now for example we are faddy people you know faddy but kind hearted if you were asked to wear any dress which we might give you you would not object to our little whim heh no said i considerably astonished at his words or to sit here or sit there that would not be offensive to you oh no or to cut your hair quite short before you come to us i could hardly believe my ears as you may observe mr holmes my hair is somewhat luxuriant and of a rather peculiar tint of chestnut it has been considered artistic i could not dream of sacrificing it in this offhand fashion i am afraid that that is quite impossible said i he had been watching me eagerly out of his small eyes and i could see a shadow pass over his face as i spoke i am afraid that it is quite essential said he it is a little fancy of my wife s and ladies fancies you know madam ladies fancies must be consulted and so you won t cut your hair no sir i really could not i answered firmly ah very well then that quite settles the matter it is a pity because in other respects you would really have done very nicely in that case miss stoper i had best inspect a few more of your young ladies the manageress had sat all this while busy with her papers without a word to either of us but she glanced at me now with so much annoyance upon her face that i could not help suspecting that she had lost a handsome commission through my refusal do you desire your name to be kept upon the books she asked if you please miss stoper well really it seems rather useless since you refuse the most excellent offers in this fashion said she sharply you can hardly expect us to exert ourselves to find another such opening for you good day to you miss hunter she struck a gong upon the table and i was shown out by the page well mr holmes when i got back to my lodgings and found little enough in the cupboard and two or three bills upon the table i began to ask myself whether i had not done a very foolish thing after all if these people had strange fads and expected obedience on the most extraordinary matters they were at least ready to pay for their eccentricity very few governesses in england are getting a year besides what use was my hair to me many people are improved by wearing it short and perhaps i should be among the number next day i was inclined to think that i had made a mistake and by the day after i was sure of it i had almost overcome my pride so far as to go back to the agency and inquire whether the place was still open when i received this letter from the gentleman himself i have it here and i will read it to you the copper beeches near winchester dear miss hunter miss stoper has very kindly given me your address and i write from here to ask you whether you have reconsidered your decision my wife is very anxious that you should come for she has been much attracted by my description of you we are willing to give a quarter or a year so as to recompense you for any little inconvenience which our fads may cause you they are not very exacting after all my wife is fond of a particular shade of electric blue and would like you to wear such a dress indoors in the morning you need not however go to the expense of purchasing one as we have one belonging to my dear daughter alice now in philadelphia which would i should think fit you very well then as to sitting here or there or amusing yourself in any manner indicated that need cause you no inconvenience as regards your hair it is no doubt a pity especially as i could not help remarking its beauty during our short interview but i am afraid that i must remain firm upon this point and i only hope that the increased salary may recompense you for the loss your duties as far as the child is concerned are very light now do try to come and i shall meet you with the dog cart at winchester let me know your train yours faithfully jephro rucastle that is the letter which i have just received mr holmes and my mind is made up that i will accept it i thought however that before taking the final step i should like to submit the whole matter to your consideration well miss hunter if your mind is made up that settles the question said holmes smiling but you would not advise me to refuse i confess that it is not the situation which i should like to see a sister of mine apply for what is the meaning of it all mr holmes ah i have no data i cannot tell perhaps you have yourself formed some opinion well there seems to me to be only one possible solution mr rucastle seemed to be a very kind good natured man is it not possible that his wife is a lunatic that he desires to keep the matter quiet for fear she should be taken to an asylum and that he humours her fancies in every way in order to prevent an outbreak that is a possible solution in fact as matters stand it is the most probable one but in any case it does not seem to be a nice household for a young lady but the money mr holmes the money well yes of course the pay is good too good that is what makes me uneasy why should they give you a year when they could have their pick for there must be some strong reason behind i thought that if i told you the circumstances you would understand afterwards if i wanted your help i should feel so much stronger if i felt that you were at the back of me oh you may carry that feeling away with you i assure you that your little problem promises to be the most interesting which has come my way for some months there is something distinctly novel about some of the features if you should find yourself in doubt or in danger danger what danger do you foresee holmes shook his head gravely it would cease to be a danger if we could define it said he but at any time day or night a telegram would bring me down to your help that is enough she rose briskly from her chair with the anxiety all swept from her face i shall go down to hampshire quite easy in my mind now i shall write to mr rucastle at once sacrifice my poor hair to night and start for winchester to morrow with a few grateful words to holmes she bade us both good night and bustled off upon her way at least said i as we heard her quick firm steps descending the stairs she seems to be a young lady who is very well able to take care of herself and she would need to be said holmes gravely i am much mistaken if we do not hear from her before many days are past it was not very long before my friend s prediction was fulfilled a fortnight went by during which i frequently found my thoughts turning in her direction and wondering what strange side alley of human experience this lonely woman had strayed into the unusual salary the curious conditions the light duties all pointed to something abnormal though whether a fad or a plot or whether the man were a philanthropist or a villain it was quite beyond my powers to determine as to holmes i observed that he sat frequently for half an hour on end with knitted brows and an abstracted air but he swept the matter away with a wave of his hand when i mentioned it data data data he cried impatiently i can t make bricks without clay and yet he would always wind up by muttering that no sister of his should ever have accepted such a situation the telegram which we eventually received came late one night just as i was thinking of turning in and holmes was settling down to one of those all night chemical researches which he frequently indulged in when i would leave him stooping over a retort and a test tube at night and find him in the same position when i came down to breakfast in the morning he opened the yellow envelope and then glancing at the message threw it across to me just look up the trains in bradshaw said he and turned back to his chemical studies the summons was a brief and urgent one please be at the black swan hotel at winchester at midday to morrow it said do come i am at my wit s end hunter will you come with me asked holmes glancing up i should wish to just look it up then there is a train at half past nine said i glancing over my bradshaw it is due at winchester at that will do very nicely then perhaps i had better postpone my analysis of the acetones as we may need to be at our best in the morning by eleven o clock the next day we were well upon our way to the old english capital holmes had been buried in the morning papers all the way down but after we had passed the hampshire border he threw them down and began to admire the scenery it was an ideal spring day a light blue sky flecked with little fleecy white clouds drifting across from west to east the sun was shining very brightly and yet there was an exhilarating nip in the air which set an edge to a man s energy all over the countryside away to the rolling hills around aldershot the little red and grey roofs of the farm steadings peeped out from amid the light green of the new foliage are they not fresh and beautiful i cried with all the enthusiasm of a man fresh from the fogs of baker street but holmes shook his head gravely do you know watson said he that it is one of the curses of a mind with a turn like mine that i must look at everything with reference to my own special subject you look at these scattered houses and you are impressed by their beauty i look at them and the only thought which comes to me is a feeling of their isolation and of the impunity with which crime may be committed there good heavens i cried who would associate crime with these dear old homesteads they always fill me with a certain horror it is my belief watson founded upon my experience that the lowest and vilest alleys in london do not present a more dreadful record of sin than does the smiling and beautiful countryside you horrify me but the reason is very obvious the pressure of public opinion can do in the town what the law cannot accomplish there is no lane so vile that the scream of a tortured child or the thud of a drunkard s blow does not beget sympathy and indignation among the neighbours and then the whole machinery of justice is ever so close that a word of complaint can set it going and there is but a step between the crime and the dock but look at these lonely houses each in its own fields filled for the most part with poor ignorant folk who know little of the law think of the deeds of hellish cruelty the hidden wickedness which may go on year in year out in such places and none the wiser had this lady who appeals to us for help gone to live in winchester i should never have had a fear for her it is the five miles of country which makes the danger still it is clear that she is not personally threatened no if she can come to winchester to meet us she can get away quite so she has her freedom what can be the matter then can you suggest no explanation i have devised seven separate explanations each of which would cover the facts as far as we know them but which of these is correct can only be determined by the fresh information which we shall no doubt find waiting for us well there is the tower of the cathedral and we shall soon learn all that miss hunter has to tell the black swan is an inn of repute in the high street at no distance from the station and there we found the young lady waiting for us she had engaged a sitting room and our lunch awaited us upon the table i am so delighted that you have come she said earnestly it is so very kind of you both but indeed i do not know what i should do your advice will be altogether invaluable to me pray tell us what has happened to you i will do so and i must be quick for i have promised mr rucastle to be back before three i got his leave to come into town this morning though he little knew for what purpose let us have everything in its due order holmes thrust his long thin legs out towards the fire and composed himself to listen in the first place i may say that i have met on the whole with no actual ill treatment from mr and mrs rucastle it is only fair to them to say that but i cannot understand them and i am not easy in my mind about them what can you not understand their reasons for their conduct but you shall have it all just as it occurred when i came down mr rucastle met me here and drove me in his dog cart to the copper beeches it is as he said beautifully situated but it is not beautiful in itself for it is a large square block of a house whitewashed but all stained and streaked with damp and bad weather there are grounds round it woods on three sides and on the fourth a field which slopes down to the southampton high road which curves past about a hundred yards from the front door this ground in front belongs to the house but the woods all round are part of lord southerton s preserves a clump of copper beeches immediately in front of the hall door has given its name to the place i was driven over by my employer who was as amiable as ever and was introduced by him that evening to his wife and the child there was no truth mr holmes in the conjecture which seemed to us to be probable in your rooms at baker street mrs rucastle is not mad i found her to be a silent pale faced woman much younger than her husband not more than thirty i should think while he can hardly be less than forty five from their conversation i have gathered that they have been married about seven years that he was a widower and that his only child by the first wife was the daughter who has gone to philadelphia mr rucastle told me in private that the reason why she had left them was that she had an unreasoning aversion to her stepmother as the daughter could not have been less than twenty i can quite imagine that her position must have been uncomfortable with her father s young wife mrs rucastle seemed to me to be colourless in mind as well as in feature she impressed me neither favourably nor the reverse she was a nonentity it was easy to see that she was passionately devoted both to her husband and to her little son her light grey eyes wandered continually from one to the other noting every little want and forestalling it if possible he was kind to her also in his bluff boisterous fashion and on the whole they seemed to be a happy couple and yet she had some secret sorrow this woman she would often be lost in deep thought with the saddest look upon her face more than once i have surprised her in tears i have thought sometimes that it was the disposition of her child which weighed upon her mind for i have never met so utterly spoiled and so ill natured a little creature he is small for his age with a head which is quite disproportionately large his whole life appears to be spent in an alternation between savage fits of passion and gloomy intervals of sulking giving pain to any creature weaker than himself seems to be his one idea of amusement and he shows quite remarkable talent in planning the capture of mice little birds and insects but i would rather not talk about the creature mr holmes and indeed he has little to do with my story i am glad of all details remarked my friend whether they seem to you to be relevant or not i shall try not to miss anything of importance the one unpleasant thing about the house which struck me at once was the appearance and conduct of the servants there are only two a man and his wife toller for that is his name is a rough uncouth man with grizzled hair and whiskers and a perpetual smell of drink twice since i have been with them he has been quite drunk and yet mr rucastle seemed to take no notice of it his wife is a very tall and strong woman with a sour face as silent as mrs rucastle and much less amiable they are a most unpleasant couple but fortunately i spend most of my time in the nursery and my own room which are next to each other in one corner of the building for two days after my arrival at the copper beeches my life was very quiet on the third mrs rucastle came down just after breakfast and whispered something to her husband oh yes said he turning to me we are very much obliged to you miss hunter for falling in with our whims so far as to cut your hair i assure you that it has not detracted in the tiniest iota from your appearance we shall now see how the electric blue dress will become you you will find it laid out upon the bed in your room and if you would be so good as to put it on we should both be extremely obliged the dress which i found waiting for me was of a peculiar shade of blue it was of excellent material a sort of beige but it bore unmistakable signs of having been worn before it could not have been a better fit if i had been measured for it both mr and mrs rucastle expressed a delight at the look of it which seemed quite exaggerated in its vehemence they were waiting for me in the drawing room which is a very large room stretching along the entire front of the house with three long windows reaching down to the floor a chair had been placed close to the central window with its back turned towards it in this i was asked to sit and then mr rucastle walking up and down on the other side of the room began to tell me a series of the funniest stories that i have ever listened to you cannot imagine how comical he was and i laughed until i was quite weary mrs rucastle however who has evidently no sense of humour never so much as smiled but sat with her hands in her lap and a sad anxious look upon her face after an hour or so mr rucastle suddenly remarked that it was time to commence the duties of the day and that i might change my dress and go to little edward in the nursery two days later this same performance was gone through under exactly similar circumstances again i changed my dress again i sat in the window and again i laughed very heartily at the funny stories of which my employer had an immense r pertoire and which he told inimitably then he handed me a yellow backed novel and moving my chair a little sideways that my own shadow might not fall upon the page he begged me to read aloud to him i read for about ten minutes beginning in the heart of a chapter and then suddenly in the middle of a sentence he ordered me to cease and to change my dress you can easily imagine mr holmes how curious i became as to what the meaning of this extraordinary performance could possibly be they were always very careful i observed to turn my face away from the window so that i became consumed with the desire to see what was going on behind my back at first it seemed to be impossible but i soon devised a means my hand mirror had been broken so a happy thought seized me and i concealed a piece of the glass in my handkerchief on the next occasion in the midst of my laughter i put my handkerchief up to my eyes and was able with a little management to see all that there was behind me i confess that i was disappointed there was nothing at least that was my first impression at the second glance however i perceived that there was a man standing in the southampton road a small bearded man in a grey suit who seemed to be looking in my direction the road is an important highway and there are usually people there this man however was leaning against the railings which bordered our field and was looking earnestly up i lowered my handkerchief and glanced at mrs rucastle to find her eyes fixed upon me with a most searching gaze she said nothing but i am convinced that she had divined that i had a mirror in my hand and had seen what was behind me she rose at once jephro said she there is an impertinent fellow upon the road there who stares up at miss hunter no friend of yours miss hunter he asked no i know no one in these parts dear me how very impertinent kindly turn round and motion to him to go away surely it would be better to take no notice no no we should have him loitering here always kindly turn round and wave him away like that i did as i was told and at the same instant mrs rucastle drew down the blind that was a week ago and from that time i have not sat again in the window nor have i worn the blue dress nor seen the man in the road pray continue said holmes your narrative promises to be a most interesting one you will find it rather disconnected i fear and there may prove to be little relation between the different incidents of which i speak on the very first day that i was at the copper beeches mr rucastle took me to a small outhouse which stands near the kitchen door as we approached it i heard the sharp rattling of a chain and the sound as of a large animal moving about look in here said mr rucastle showing me a slit between two planks is he not a beauty i looked through and was conscious of two glowing eyes and of a vague figure huddled up in the darkness don t be frightened said my employer laughing at the start which i had given it s only carlo my mastiff i call him mine but really old toller my groom is the only man who can do anything with him we feed him once a day and not too much then so that he is always as keen as mustard toller lets him loose every night and god help the trespasser whom he lays his fangs upon for goodness sake don t you ever on any pretext set your foot over the threshold at night for it s as much as your life is worth the warning was no idle one for two nights later i happened to look out of my bedroom window about two o clock in the morning it was a beautiful moonlight night and the lawn in front of the house was silvered over and almost as bright as day i was standing rapt in the peaceful beauty of the scene when i was aware that something was moving under the shadow of the copper beeches as it emerged into the moonshine i saw what it was it was a giant dog as large as a calf tawny tinted with hanging jowl black muzzle and huge projecting bones it walked slowly across the lawn and vanished into the shadow upon the other side that dreadful sentinel sent a chill to my heart which i do not think that any burglar could have done and now i have a very strange experience to tell you i had as you know cut off my hair in london and i had placed it in a great coil at the bottom of my trunk one evening after the child was in bed i began to amuse myself by examining the furniture of my room and by rearranging my own little things there was an old chest of drawers in the room the two upper ones empty and open the lower one locked i had filled the first two with my linen and as i had still much to pack away i was naturally annoyed at not having the use of the third drawer it struck me that it might have been fastened by a mere oversight so i took out my bunch of keys and tried to open it the very first key fitted to perfection and i drew the drawer open there was only one thing in it but i am sure that you would never guess what it was it was my coil of hair i took it up and examined it it was of the same peculiar tint and the same thickness but then the impossibility of the thing obtruded itself upon me how could my hair have been locked in the drawer with trembling hands i undid my trunk turned out the contents and drew from the bottom my own hair i laid the two tresses together and i assure you that they were identical was it not extraordinary puzzle as i would i could make nothing at all of what it meant i returned the strange hair to the drawer and i said nothing of the matter to the rucastles as i felt that i had put myself in the wrong by opening a drawer which they had locked i am naturally observant as you may have remarked mr holmes and i soon had a pretty good plan of the whole house in my head there was one wing however which appeared not to be inhabited at all a door which faced that which led into the quarters of the tollers opened into this suite but it was invariably locked one day however as i ascended the stair i met mr rucastle coming out through this door his keys in his hand and a look on his face which made him a very different person to the round jovial man to whom i was accustomed his cheeks were red his brow was all crinkled with anger and the veins stood out at his temples with passion he locked the door and hurried past me without a word or a look this aroused my curiosity so when i went out for a walk in the grounds with my charge i strolled round to the side from which i could see the windows of this part of the house there were four of them in a row three of which were simply dirty while the fourth was shuttered up they were evidently all deserted as i strolled up and down glancing at them occasionally mr rucastle came out to me looking as merry and jovial as ever ah said he you must not think me rude if i passed you without a word my dear young lady i was preoccupied with business matters i assured him that i was not offended by the way said i you seem to have quite a suite of spare rooms up there and one of them has the shutters up he looked surprised and as it seemed to me a little startled at my remark photography is one of my hobbies said he i have made my dark room up there but dear me what an observant young lady we have come upon who would have believed it who would have ever believed it he spoke in a jesting tone but there was no jest in his eyes as he looked at me i read suspicion there and annoyance but no jest well mr holmes from the moment that i understood that there was something about that suite of rooms which i was not to know i was all on fire to go over them it was not mere curiosity though i have my share of that it was more a feeling of duty a feeling that some good might come from my penetrating to this place they talk of woman s instinct perhaps it was woman s instinct which gave me that feeling at any rate it was there and i was keenly on the lookout for any chance to pass the forbidden door it was only yesterday that the chance came i may tell you that besides mr rucastle both toller and his wife find something to do in these deserted rooms and i once saw him carrying a large black linen bag with him through the door recently he has been drinking hard and yesterday evening he was very drunk and when i came upstairs there was the key in the door i have no doubt at all that he had left it there mr and mrs rucastle were both downstairs and the child was with them so that i had an admirable opportunity i turned the key gently in the lock opened the door and slipped through there was a little passage in front of me unpapered and uncarpeted which turned at a right angle at the farther end round this corner were three doors in a line the first and third of which were open they each led into an empty room dusty and cheerless with two windows in the one and one in the other so thick with dirt that the evening light glimmered dimly through them the centre door was closed and across the outside of it had been fastened one of the broad bars of an iron bed padlocked at one end to a ring in the wall and fastened at the other with stout cord the door itself was locked as well and the key was not there this barricaded door corresponded clearly with the shuttered window outside and yet i could see by the glimmer from beneath it that the room was not in darkness evidently there was a skylight which let in light from above as i stood in the passage gazing at the sinister door and wondering what secret it might veil i suddenly heard the sound of steps within the room and saw a shadow pass backward and forward against the little slit of dim light which shone out from under the door a mad unreasoning terror rose up in me at the sight mr holmes my overstrung nerves failed me suddenly and i turned and ran ran as though some dreadful hand were behind me clutching at the skirt of my dress i rushed down the passage through the door and straight into the arms of mr rucastle who was waiting outside so said he smiling it was you then i thought that it must be when i saw the door open oh i am so frightened i panted my dear young lady my dear young lady you cannot think how caressing and soothing his manner was and what has frightened you my dear young lady but his voice was just a little too coaxing he overdid it i was keenly on my guard against him i was foolish enough to go into the empty wing i answered but it is so lonely and eerie in this dim light that i was frightened and ran out again oh it is so dreadfully still in there only that said he looking at me keenly why what did you think i asked why do you think that i lock this door i am sure that i do not know it is to keep people out who have no business there do you see he was still smiling in the most amiable manner i am sure if i had known well then you know now and if you ever put your foot over that threshold again here in an instant the smile hardened into a grin of rage and he glared down at me with the face of a demon i ll throw you to the mastiff i was so terrified that i do not know what i did i suppose that i must have rushed past him into my room i remember nothing until i found myself lying on my bed trembling all over then i thought of you mr holmes i could not live there longer without some advice i was frightened of the house of the man of the woman of the servants even of the child they were all horrible to me if i could only bring you down all would be well of course i might have fled from the house but my curiosity was almost as strong as my fears my mind was soon made up i would send you a wire i put on my hat and cloak went down to the office which is about half a mile from the house and then returned feeling very much easier a horrible doubt came into my mind as i approached the door lest the dog might be loose but i remembered that toller had drunk himself into a state of insensibility that evening and i knew that he was the only one in the household who had any influence with the savage creature or who would venture to set him free i slipped in in safety and lay awake half the night in my joy at the thought of seeing you i had no difficulty in getting leave to come into winchester this morning but i must be back before three o clock for mr and mrs rucastle are going on a visit and will be away all the evening so that i must look after the child now i have told you all my adventures mr holmes and i should be very glad if you could tell me what it all means and above all what i should do holmes and i had listened spellbound to this extraordinary story my friend rose now and paced up and down the room his hands in his pockets and an expression of the most profound gravity upon his face is toller still drunk he asked yes i heard his wife tell mrs rucastle that she could do nothing with him that is well and the rucastles go out to night yes is there a cellar with a good strong lock yes the wine cellar you seem to me to have acted all through this matter like a very brave and sensible girl miss hunter do you think that you could perform one more feat i should not ask it of you if i did not think you a quite exceptional woman i will try what is it we shall be at the copper beeches by seven o clock my friend and i the rucastles will be gone by that time and toller will we hope be incapable there only remains mrs toller who might give the alarm if you could send her into the cellar on some errand and then turn the key upon her you would facilitate matters immensely i will do it excellent we shall then look thoroughly into the affair of course there is only one feasible explanation you have been brought there to personate someone and the real person is imprisoned in this chamber that is obvious as to who this prisoner is i have no doubt that it is the daughter miss alice rucastle if i remember right who was said to have gone to america you were chosen doubtless as resembling her in height figure and the colour of your hair hers had been cut off very possibly in some illness through which she has passed and so of course yours had to be sacrificed also by a curious chance you came upon her tresses the man in the road was undoubtedly some friend of hers possibly her fianc and no doubt as you wore the girl s dress and were so like her he was convinced from your laughter whenever he saw you and afterwards from your gesture that miss rucastle was perfectly happy and that she no longer desired his attentions the dog is let loose at night to prevent him from endeavouring to communicate with her so much is fairly clear the most serious point in the case is the disposition of the child what on earth has that to do with it i ejaculated my dear watson you as a medical man are continually gaining light as to the tendencies of a child by the study of the parents don t you see that the converse is equally valid i have frequently gained my first real insight into the character of parents by studying their children this child s disposition is abnormally cruel merely for cruelty s sake and whether he derives this from his smiling father as i should suspect or from his mother it bodes evil for the poor girl who is in their power i am sure that you are right mr holmes cried our client a thousand things come back to me which make me certain that you have hit it oh let us lose not an instant in bringing help to this poor creature we must be circumspect for we are dealing with a very cunning man we can do nothing until seven o clock at that hour we shall be with you and it will not be long before we solve the mystery we were as good as our word for it was just seven when we reached the copper beeches having put up our trap at a wayside public house the group of trees with their dark leaves shining like burnished metal in the light of the setting sun were sufficient to mark the house even had miss hunter not been standing smiling on the door step have you managed it asked holmes a loud thudding noise came from somewhere downstairs that is mrs toller in the cellar said she her husband lies snoring on the kitchen rug here are his keys which are the duplicates of mr rucastle s you have done well indeed cried holmes with enthusiasm now lead the way and we shall soon see the end of this black business we passed up the stair unlocked the door followed on down a passage and found ourselves in front of the barricade which miss hunter had described holmes cut the cord and removed the transverse bar then he tried the various keys in the lock but without success no sound came from within and at the silence holmes face clouded over i trust that we are not too late said he i think miss hunter that we had better go in without you now watson put your shoulder to it and we shall see whether we cannot make our way in it was an old rickety door and gave at once before our united strength together we rushed into the room it was empty there was no furniture save a little pallet bed a small table and a basketful of linen the skylight above was open and the prisoner gone there has been some villainy here said holmes this beauty has guessed miss hunter s intentions and has carried his victim off but how through the skylight we shall soon see how he managed it he swung himself up onto the roof ah yes he cried here s the end of a long light ladder against the eaves that is how he did it but it is impossible said miss hunter the ladder was not there when the rucastles went away he has come back and done it i tell you that he is a clever and dangerous man i should not be very much surprised if this were he whose step i hear now upon the stair i think watson that it would be as well for you to have your pistol ready the words were hardly out of his mouth before a man appeared at the door of the room a very fat and burly man with a heavy stick in his hand miss hunter screamed and shrunk against the wall at the sight of him but sherlock holmes sprang forward and confronted him you villain said he where s your daughter the fat man cast his eyes round and then up at the open skylight it is for me to ask you that he shrieked you thieves spies and thieves i have caught you have i you are in my power i ll serve you he turned and clattered down the stairs as hard as he could go he s gone for the dog cried miss hunter i have my revolver said i better close the front door cried holmes and we all rushed down the stairs together we had hardly reached the hall when we heard the baying of a hound and then a scream of agony with a horrible worrying sound which it was dreadful to listen to an elderly man with a red face and shaking limbs came staggering out at a side door my god he cried someone has loosed the dog it s not been fed for two days quick quick or it ll be too late holmes and i rushed out and round the angle of the house with toller hurrying behind us there was the huge famished brute its black muzzle buried in rucastle s throat while he writhed and screamed upon the ground running up i blew its brains out and it fell over with its keen white teeth still meeting in the great creases of his neck with much labour we separated them and carried him living but horribly mangled into the house we laid him upon the drawing room sofa and having dispatched the sobered toller to bear the news to his wife i did what i could to relieve his pain we were all assembled round him when the door opened and a tall gaunt woman entered the room mrs toller cried miss hunter yes miss mr rucastle let me out when he came back before he went up to you ah miss it is a pity you didn t let me know what you were planning for i would have told you that your pains were wasted ha said holmes looking keenly at her it is clear that mrs toller knows more about this matter than anyone else yes sir i do and i am ready enough to tell what i know then pray sit down and let us hear it for there are several points on which i must confess that i am still in the dark i will soon make it clear to you said she and i d have done so before now if i could ha got out from the cellar if there s police court business over this you ll remember that i was the one that stood your friend and that i was miss alice s friend too she was never happy at home miss alice wasn t from the time that her father married again she was slighted like and had no say in anything but it never really became bad for her until after she met mr fowler at a friend s house as well as i could learn miss alice had rights of her own by will but she was so quiet and patient she was that she never said a word about them but just left everything in mr rucastle s hands he knew he was safe with her but when there was a chance of a husband coming forward who would ask for all that the law would give him then her father thought it time to put a stop on it he wanted her to sign a paper so that whether she married or not he could use her money when she wouldn t do it he kept on worrying her until she got brain fever and for six weeks was at death s door then she got better at last all worn to a shadow and with her beautiful hair cut off but that didn t make no change in her young man and he stuck to her as true as man could be ah said holmes i think that what you have been good enough to tell us makes the matter fairly clear and that i can deduce all that remains mr rucastle then i presume took to this system of imprisonment yes sir and brought miss hunter down from london in order to get rid of the disagreeable persistence of mr fowler that was it sir but mr fowler being a persevering man as a good seaman should be blockaded the house and having met you succeeded by certain arguments metallic or otherwise in convincing you that your interests were the same as his mr fowler was a very kind spoken free handed gentleman said mrs toller serenely and in this way he managed that your good man should have no want of drink and that a ladder should be ready at the moment when your master had gone out you have it sir just as it happened i am sure we owe you an apology mrs toller said holmes for you have certainly cleared up everything which puzzled us and here comes the country surgeon and mrs rucastle so i think watson that we had best escort miss hunter back to winchester as it seems to me that our locus standi now is rather a questionable one and thus was solved the mystery of the sinister house with the copper beeches in front of the door mr rucastle survived but was always a broken man kept alive solely through the care of his devoted wife they still live with their old servants who probably know so much of rucastle s past life that he finds it difficult to part from them mr fowler and miss rucastle were married by special license in southampton the day after their flight and he is now the holder of a government appointment in the island of mauritius as to miss violet hunter my friend holmes

dracula chapter i jonathan harker s journal kept in shorthand may bistritz left munich at p m on st may arriving at vienna early next morning should have arrived at but train was an hour late buda pesth seems a wonderful place from the glimpse which i got of it from the train and the little i could walk through the streets i feared to go very far from the station as we had arrived late and would start as near the correct time as possible the impression i had was that we were leaving the west and entering the east the most western of splendid bridges over the danube which is here of noble width and depth took us among the traditions of turkish rule we left in pretty good time and came after nightfall to klausenburgh here i stopped for the night at the hotel royale i had for dinner or rather supper a chicken done up some way with red pepper which was very good but thirsty mem get recipe for mina i asked the waiter and he said it was called paprika hendl and that as it was a national dish i should be able to get it anywhere along the carpathians i found my smattering of german very useful here indeed i don t know how i should be able to get on without it having had some time at my disposal when in london i had visited the british museum and made search among the books and maps in the library regarding transylvania it had struck me that some foreknowledge of the country could hardly fail to have some importance in dealing with a nobleman of that country i find that the district he named is in the extreme east of the country just on the borders of three states transylvania moldavia and bukovina in the midst of the carpathian mountains one of the wildest and least known portions of europe i was not able to light on any map or work giving the exact locality of the castle dracula as there are no maps of this country as yet to compare with our own ordnance survey maps but i found that bistritz the post town named by count dracula is a fairly well known place i shall enter here some of my notes as they may refresh my memory when i talk over my travels with mina in the population of transylvania there are four distinct nationalities saxons in the south and mixed with them the wallachs who are the descendants of the dacians magyars in the west and szekelys in the east and north i am going among the latter who claim to be descended from attila and the huns this may be so for when the magyars conquered the country in the eleventh century they found the huns settled in it i read that every known superstition in the world is gathered into the horseshoe of the carpathians as if it were the centre of some sort of imaginative whirlpool if so my stay may be very interesting mem i must ask the count all about them i did not sleep well though my bed was comfortable enough for i had all sorts of queer dreams there was a dog howling all night under my window which may have had something to do with it or it may have been the paprika for i had to drink up all the water in my carafe and was still thirsty towards morning i slept and was wakened by the continuous knocking at my door so i guess i must have been sleeping soundly then i had for breakfast more paprika and a sort of porridge of maize flour which they said was mamaliga and egg plant stuffed with forcemeat a very excellent dish which they call impletata mem get recipe for this also i had to hurry breakfast for the train started a little before eight or rather it ought to have done so for after rushing to the station at i had to sit in the carriage for more than an hour before we began to move it seems to me that the further east you go the more unpunctual are the trains what ought they to be in china all day long we seemed to dawdle through a country which was full of beauty of every kind sometimes we saw little towns or castles on the top of steep hills such as we see in old missals sometimes we ran by rivers and streams which seemed from the wide stony margin on each side of them to be subject to great floods it takes a lot of water and running strong to sweep the outside edge of a river clear at every station there were groups of people sometimes crowds and in all sorts of attire some of them were just like the peasants at home or those i saw coming through france and germany with short jackets and round hats and home made trousers but others were very picturesque the women looked pretty except when you got near them but they were very clumsy about the waist they had all full white sleeves of some kind or other and most of them had big belts with a lot of strips of something fluttering from them like the dresses in a ballet but of course there were petticoats under them the strangest figures we saw were the slovaks who were more barbarian than the rest with their big cow boy hats great baggy dirty white trousers white linen shirts and enormous heavy leather belts nearly a foot wide all studded over with brass nails they wore high boots with their trousers tucked into them and had long black hair and heavy black moustaches they are very picturesque but do not look prepossessing on the stage they would be set down at once as some old oriental band of brigands they are however i am told very harmless and rather wanting in natural self assertion it was on the dark side of twilight when we got to bistritz which is a very interesting old place being practically on the frontier for the borgo pass leads from it into bukovina it has had a very stormy existence and it certainly shows marks of it fifty years ago a series of great fires took place which made terrible havoc on five separate occasions at the very beginning of the seventeenth century it underwent a siege of three weeks and lost people the casualties of war proper being assisted by famine and disease count dracula had directed me to go to the golden krone hotel which i found to my great delight to be thoroughly old fashioned for of course i wanted to see all i could of the ways of the country i was evidently expected for when i got near the door i faced a cheery looking elderly woman in the usual peasant dress white undergarment with long double apron front and back of coloured stuff fitting almost too tight for modesty when i came close she bowed and said the herr englishman yes i said jonathan harker she smiled and gave some message to an elderly man in white shirt sleeves who had followed her to the door he went but immediately returned with a letter my friend welcome to the carpathians i am anxiously expecting you sleep well to night at three to morrow the diligence will start for bukovina a place on it is kept for you at the borgo pass my carriage will await you and will bring you to me i trust that your journey from london has been a happy one and that you will enjoy your stay in my beautiful land your friend dracula may i found that my landlord had got a letter from the count directing him to secure the best place on the coach for me but on making inquiries as to details he seemed somewhat reticent and pretended that he could not understand my german this could not be true because up to then he had understood it perfectly at least he answered my questions exactly as if he did he and his wife the old lady who had received me looked at each other in a frightened sort of way he mumbled out that the money had been sent in a letter and that was all he knew when i asked him if he knew count dracula and could tell me anything of his castle both he and his wife crossed themselves and saying that they knew nothing at all simply refused to speak further it was so near the time of starting that i had no time to ask any one else for it was all very mysterious and not by any means comforting just before i was leaving the old lady came up to my room and said in a very hysterical way must you go oh young herr must you go she was in such an excited state that she seemed to have lost her grip of what german she knew and mixed it all up with some other language which i did not know at all i was just able to follow her by asking many questions when i told her that i must go at once and that i was engaged on important business she asked again do you know what day it is i answered that it was the fourth of may she shook her head as she said again oh yes i know that i know that but do you know what day it is on my saying that i did not understand she went on it is the eve of st george s day do you not know that to night when the clock strikes midnight all the evil things in the world will have full sway do you know where you are going and what you are going to she was in such evident distress that i tried to comfort her but without effect finally she went down on her knees and implored me not to go at least to wait a day or two before starting it was all very ridiculous but i did not feel comfortable however there was business to be done and i could allow nothing to interfere with it i therefore tried to raise her up and said as gravely as i could that i thanked her but my duty was imperative and that i must go she then rose and dried her eyes and taking a crucifix from her neck offered it to me i did not know what to do for as an english churchman i have been taught to regard such things as in some measure idolatrous and yet it seemed so ungracious to refuse an old lady meaning so well and in such a state of mind she saw i suppose the doubt in my face for she put the rosary round my neck and said for your mother s sake and went out of the room i am writing up this part of the diary whilst i am waiting for the coach which is of course late and the crucifix is still round my neck whether it is the old lady s fear or the many ghostly traditions of this place or the crucifix itself i do not know but i am not feeling nearly as easy in my mind as usual if this book should ever reach mina before i do let it bring my good bye here comes the coach may the castle the grey of the morning has passed and the sun is high over the distant horizon which seems jagged whether with trees or hills i know not for it is so far off that big things and little are mixed i am not sleepy and as i am not to be called till i awake naturally i write till sleep comes there are many odd things to put down and lest who reads them may fancy that i dined too well before i left bistritz let me put down my dinner exactly i dined on what they called robber steak bits of bacon onion and beef seasoned with red pepper and strung on sticks and roasted over the fire in the simple style of the london cat s meat the wine was golden mediasch which produces a queer sting on the tongue which is however not disagreeable i had only a couple of glasses of this and nothing else when i got on the coach the driver had not taken his seat and i saw him talking with the landlady they were evidently talking of me for every now and then they looked at me and some of the people who were sitting on the bench outside the door which they call by a name meaning word bearer came and listened and then looked at me most of them pityingly i could hear a lot of words often repeated queer words for there were many nationalities in the crowd so i quietly got my polyglot dictionary from my bag and looked them out i must say they were not cheering to me for amongst them were ordog satan pokol hell stregoica witch vrolok and vlkoslak both of which mean the same thing one being slovak and the other servian for something that is either were wolf or vampire mem i must ask the count about these superstitions when we started the crowd round the inn door which had by this time swelled to a considerable size all made the sign of the cross and pointed two fingers towards me with some difficulty i got a fellow passenger to tell me what they meant he would not answer at first but on learning that i was english he explained that it was a charm or guard against the evil eye this was not very pleasant for me just starting for an unknown place to meet an unknown man but every one seemed so kind hearted and so sorrowful and so sympathetic that i could not but be touched i shall never forget the last glimpse which i had of the inn yard and its crowd of picturesque figures all crossing themselves as they stood round the wide archway with its background of rich foliage of oleander and orange trees in green tubs clustered in the centre of the yard then our driver whose wide linen drawers covered the whole front of the box seat gotza they call them cracked his big whip over his four small horses which ran abreast and we set off on our journey i soon lost sight and recollection of ghostly fears in the beauty of the scene as we drove along although had i known the language or rather languages which my fellow passengers were speaking i might not have been able to throw them off so easily before us lay a green sloping land full of forests and woods with here and there steep hills crowned with clumps of trees or with farmhouses the blank gable end to the road there was everywhere a bewildering mass of fruit blossom apple plum pear cherry and as we drove by i could see the green grass under the trees spangled with the fallen petals in and out amongst these green hills of what they call here the mittel land ran the road losing itself as it swept round the grassy curve or was shut out by the straggling ends of pine woods which here and there ran down the hillsides like tongues of flame the road was rugged but still we seemed to fly over it with a feverish haste i could not understand then what the haste meant but the driver was evidently bent on losing no time in reaching borgo prund i was told that this road is in summertime excellent but that it had not yet been put in order after the winter snows in this respect it is different from the general run of roads in the carpathians for it is an old tradition that they are not to be kept in too good order of old the hospadars would not repair them lest the turk should think that they were preparing to bring in foreign troops and so hasten the war which was always really at loading point beyond the green swelling hills of the mittel land rose mighty slopes of forest up to the lofty steeps of the carpathians themselves right and left of us they towered with the afternoon sun falling full upon them and bringing out all the glorious colours of this beautiful range deep blue and purple in the shadows of the peaks green and brown where grass and rock mingled and an endless perspective of jagged rock and pointed crags till these were themselves lost in the distance where the snowy peaks rose grandly here and there seemed mighty rifts in the mountains through which as the sun began to sink we saw now and again the white gleam of falling water one of my companions touched my arm as we swept round the base of a hill and opened up the lofty snow covered peak of a mountain which seemed as we wound on our serpentine way to be right before us look isten szek god s seat and he crossed himself reverently as we wound on our endless way and the sun sank lower and lower behind us the shadows of the evening began to creep round us this was emphasised by the fact that the snowy mountain top still held the sunset and seemed to glow out with a delicate cool pink here and there we passed cszeks and slovaks all in picturesque attire but i noticed that goitre was painfully prevalent by the roadside were many crosses and as we swept by my companions all crossed themselves here and there was a peasant man or woman kneeling before a shrine who did not even turn round as we approached but seemed in the self surrender of devotion to have neither eyes nor ears for the outer world there were many things new to me for instance hay ricks in the trees and here and there very beautiful masses of weeping birch their white stems shining like silver through the delicate green of the leaves now and again we passed a leiter wagon the ordinary peasant s cart with its long snake like vertebra calculated to suit the inequalities of the road on this were sure to be seated quite a group of home coming peasants the cszeks with their white and the slovaks with their coloured sheepskins the latter carrying lance fashion their long staves with axe at end as the evening fell it began to get very cold and the growing twilight seemed to merge into one dark mistiness the gloom of the trees oak beech and pine though in the valleys which ran deep between the spurs of the hills as we ascended through the pass the dark firs stood out here and there against the background of late lying snow sometimes as the road was cut through the pine woods that seemed in the darkness to be closing down upon us great masses of greyness which here and there bestrewed the trees produced a peculiarly weird and solemn effect which carried on the thoughts and grim fancies engendered earlier in the evening when the falling sunset threw into strange relief the ghost like clouds which amongst the carpathians seem to wind ceaselessly through the valleys sometimes the hills were so steep that despite our driver s haste the horses could only go slowly i wished to get down and walk up them as we do at home but the driver would not hear of it no no he said you must not walk here the dogs are too fierce and then he added with what he evidently meant for grim pleasantry for he looked round to catch the approving smile of the rest and you may have enough of such matters before you go to sleep the only stop he would make was a moment s pause to light his lamps when it grew dark there seemed to be some excitement amongst the passengers and they kept speaking to him one after the other as though urging him to further speed he lashed the horses unmercifully with his long whip and with wild cries of encouragement urged them on to further exertions then through the darkness i could see a sort of patch of grey light ahead of us as though there were a cleft in the hills the excitement of the passengers grew greater the crazy coach rocked on its great leather springs and swayed like a boat tossed on a stormy sea i had to hold on the road grew more level and we appeared to fly along then the mountains seemed to come nearer to us on each side and to frown down upon us we were entering on the borgo pass one by one several of the passengers offered me gifts which they pressed upon me with an earnestness which would take no denial these were certainly of an odd and varied kind but each was given in simple good faith with a kindly word and a blessing and that strange mixture of fear meaning movements which i had seen outside the hotel at bistritz the sign of the cross and the guard against the evil eye then as we flew along the driver leaned forward and on each side the passengers craning over the edge of the coach peered eagerly into the darkness it was evident that something very exciting was either happening or expected but though i asked each passenger no one would give me the slightest explanation this state of excitement kept on for some little time and at last we saw before us the pass opening out on the eastern side there were dark rolling clouds overhead and in the air the heavy oppressive sense of thunder it seemed as though the mountain range had separated two atmospheres and that now we had got into the thunderous one i was now myself looking out for the conveyance which was to take me to the count each moment i expected to see the glare of lamps through the blackness but all was dark the only light was the flickering rays of our own lamps in which the steam from our hard driven horses rose in a white cloud we could see now the sandy road lying white before us but there was on it no sign of a vehicle the passengers drew back with a sigh of gladness which seemed to mock my own disappointment i was already thinking what i had best do when the driver looking at his watch said to the others something which i could hardly hear it was spoken so quietly and in so low a tone i thought it was an hour less than the time then turning to me he said in german worse than my own there is no carriage here the herr is not expected after all he will now come on to bukovina and return to morrow or the next day better the next day whilst he was speaking the horses began to neigh and snort and plunge wildly so that the driver had to hold them up then amongst a chorus of screams from the peasants and a universal crossing of themselves a cal che with four horses drove up behind us overtook us and drew up beside the coach i could see from the flash of our lamps as the rays fell on them that the horses were coal black and splendid animals they were driven by a tall man with a long brown beard and a great black hat which seemed to hide his face from us i could only see the gleam of a pair of very bright eyes which seemed red in the lamplight as he turned to us he said to the driver you are early to night my friend the man stammered in reply the english herr was in a hurry to which the stranger replied that is why i suppose you wished him to go on to bukovina you cannot deceive me my friend i know too much and my horses are swift as he spoke he smiled and the lamplight fell on a hard looking mouth with very red lips and sharp looking teeth as white as ivory one of my companions whispered to another the line from burger s lenore denn die todten reiten schnell for the dead travel fast the strange driver evidently heard the words for he looked up with a gleaming smile the passenger turned his face away at the same time putting out his two fingers and crossing himself give me the herr s luggage said the driver and with exceeding alacrity my bags were handed out and put in the cal che then i descended from the side of the coach as the cal che was close alongside the driver helping me with a hand which caught my arm in a grip of steel his strength must have been prodigious without a word he shook his reins the horses turned and we swept into the darkness of the pass as i looked back i saw the steam from the horses of the coach by the light of the lamps and projected against it the figures of my late companions crossing themselves then the driver cracked his whip and called to his horses and off they swept on their way to bukovina as they sank into the darkness i felt a strange chill and a lonely feeling came over me but a cloak was thrown over my shoulders and a rug across my knees and the driver said in excellent german the night is chill mein herr and my master the count bade me take all care of you there is a flask of slivovitz the plum brandy of the country underneath the seat if you should require it i did not take any but it was a comfort to know it was there all the same i felt a little strangely and not a little frightened i think had there been any alternative i should have taken it instead of prosecuting that unknown night journey the carriage went at a hard pace straight along then we made a complete turn and went along another straight road it seemed to me that we were simply going over and over the same ground again and so i took note of some salient point and found that this was so i would have liked to have asked the driver what this all meant but i really feared to do so for i thought that placed as i was any protest would have had no effect in case there had been an intention to delay by and by however as i was curious to know how time was passing i struck a match and by its flame looked at my watch it was within a few minutes of midnight this gave me a sort of shock for i suppose the general superstition about midnight was increased by my recent experiences i waited with a sick feeling of suspense then a dog began to howl somewhere in a farmhouse far down the road a long agonised wailing as if from fear the sound was taken up by another dog and then another and another till borne on the wind which now sighed softly through the pass a wild howling began which seemed to come from all over the country as far as the imagination could grasp it through the gloom of the night at the first howl the horses began to strain and rear but the driver spoke to them soothingly and they quieted down but shivered and sweated as though after a runaway from sudden fright then far off in the distance from the mountains on each side of us began a louder and a sharper howling that of wolves which affected both the horses and myself in the same way for i was minded to jump from the cal che and run whilst they reared again and plunged madly so that the driver had to use all his great strength to keep them from bolting in a few minutes however my own ears got accustomed to the sound and the horses so far became quiet that the driver was able to descend and to stand before them he petted and soothed them and whispered something in their ears as i have heard of horse tamers doing and with extraordinary effect for under his caresses they became quite manageable again though they still trembled the driver again took his seat and shaking his reins started off at a great pace this time after going to the far side of the pass he suddenly turned down a narrow roadway which ran sharply to the right soon we were hemmed in with trees which in places arched right over the roadway till we passed as through a tunnel and again great frowning rocks guarded us boldly on either side though we were in shelter we could hear the rising wind for it moaned and whistled through the rocks and the branches of the trees crashed together as we swept along it grew colder and colder still and fine powdery snow began to fall so that soon we and all around us were covered with a white blanket the keen wind still carried the howling of the dogs though this grew fainter as we went on our way the baying of the wolves sounded nearer and nearer as though they were closing round on us from every side i grew dreadfully afraid and the horses shared my fear the driver however was not in the least disturbed he kept turning his head to left and right but i could not see anything through the darkness suddenly away on our left i saw a faint flickering blue flame the driver saw it at the same moment he at once checked the horses and jumping to the ground disappeared into the darkness i did not know what to do the less as the howling of the wolves grew closer but while i wondered the driver suddenly appeared again and without a word took his seat and we resumed our journey i think i must have fallen asleep and kept dreaming of the incident for it seemed to be repeated endlessly and now looking back it is like a sort of awful nightmare once the flame appeared so near the road that even in the darkness around us i could watch the driver s motions he went rapidly to where the blue flame arose it must have been very faint for it did not seem to illumine the place around it at all and gathering a few stones formed them into some device once there appeared a strange optical effect when he stood between me and the flame he did not obstruct it for i could see its ghostly flicker all the same this startled me but as the effect was only momentary i took it that my eyes deceived me straining through the darkness then for a time there were no blue flames and we sped onwards through the gloom with the howling of the wolves around us as though they were following in a moving circle at last there came a time when the driver went further afield than he had yet gone and during his absence the horses began to tremble worse than ever and to snort and scream with fright i could not see any cause for it for the howling of the wolves had ceased altogether but just then the moon sailing through the black clouds appeared behind the jagged crest of a beetling pine clad rock and by its light i saw around us a ring of wolves with white teeth and lolling red tongues with long sinewy limbs and shaggy hair they were a hundred times more terrible in the grim silence which held them than even when they howled for myself i felt a sort of paralysis of fear it is only when a man feels himself face to face with such horrors that he can understand their true import all at once the wolves began to howl as though the moonlight had had some peculiar effect on them the horses jumped about and reared and looked helplessly round with eyes that rolled in a way painful to see but the living ring of terror encompassed them on every side and they had perforce to remain within it i called to the coachman to come for it seemed to me that our only chance was to try to break out through the ring and to aid his approach i shouted and beat the side of the cal che hoping by the noise to scare the wolves from that side so as to give him a chance of reaching the trap how he came there i know not but i heard his voice raised in a tone of imperious command and looking towards the sound saw him stand in the roadway as he swept his long arms as though brushing aside some impalpable obstacle the wolves fell back and back further still just then a heavy cloud passed across the face of the moon so that we were again in darkness when i could see again the driver was climbing into the cal che and the wolves had disappeared this was all so strange and uncanny that a dreadful fear came upon me and i was afraid to speak or move the time seemed interminable as we swept on our way now in almost complete darkness for the rolling clouds obscured the moon we kept on ascending with occasional periods of quick descent but in the main always ascending suddenly i became conscious of the fact that the driver was in the act of pulling up the horses in the courtyard of a vast ruined castle from whose tall black windows came no ray of light and whose broken battlements showed a jagged line against the moonlit sky chapter ii jonathan harker s journal continued may i must have been asleep for certainly if i had been fully awake i must have noticed the approach of such a remarkable place in the gloom the courtyard looked of considerable size and as several dark ways led from it under great round arches it perhaps seemed bigger than it really is i have not yet been able to see it by daylight when the cal che stopped the driver jumped down and held out his hand to assist me to alight again i could not but notice his prodigious strength his hand actually seemed like a steel vice that could have crushed mine if he had chosen then he took out my traps and placed them on the ground beside me as i stood close to a great door old and studded with large iron nails and set in a projecting doorway of massive stone i could see even in the dim light that the stone was massively carved but that the carving had been much worn by time and weather as i stood the driver jumped again into his seat and shook the reins the horses started forward and trap and all disappeared down one of the dark openings i stood in silence where i was for i did not know what to do of bell or knocker there was no sign through these frowning walls and dark window openings it was not likely that my voice could penetrate the time i waited seemed endless and i felt doubts and fears crowding upon me what sort of place had i come to and among what kind of people what sort of grim adventure was it on which i had embarked was this a customary incident in the life of a solicitor s clerk sent out to explain the purchase of a london estate to a foreigner solicitor s clerk mina would not like that solicitor for just before leaving london i got word that my examination was successful and i am now a full blown solicitor i began to rub my eyes and pinch myself to see if i were awake it all seemed like a horrible nightmare to me and i expected that i should suddenly awake and find myself at home with the dawn struggling in through the windows as i had now and again felt in the morning after a day of overwork but my flesh answered the pinching test and my eyes were not to be deceived i was indeed awake and among the carpathians all i could do now was to be patient and to wait the coming of the morning just as i had come to this conclusion i heard a heavy step approaching behind the great door and saw through the chinks the gleam of a coming light then there was the sound of rattling chains and the clanking of massive bolts drawn back a key was turned with the loud grating noise of long disuse and the great door swung back within stood a tall old man clean shaven save for a long white moustache and clad in black from head to foot without a single speck of colour about him anywhere he held in his hand an antique silver lamp in which the flame burned without chimney or globe of any kind throwing long quivering shadows as it flickered in the draught of the open door the old man motioned me in with his right hand with a courtly gesture saying in excellent english but with a strange intonation welcome to my house enter freely and of your own will he made no motion of stepping to meet me but stood like a statue as though his gesture of welcome had fixed him into stone the instant however that i had stepped over the threshold he moved impulsively forward and holding out his hand grasped mine with a strength which made me wince an effect which was not lessened by the fact that it seemed as cold as ice more like the hand of a dead than a living man again he said welcome to my house come freely go safely and leave something of the happiness you bring the strength of the handshake was so much akin to that which i had noticed in the driver whose face i had not seen that for a moment i doubted if it were not the same person to whom i was speaking so to make sure i said interrogatively count dracula he bowed in a courtly way as he replied i am dracula and i bid you welcome mr harker to my house come in the night air is chill and you must need to eat and rest as he was speaking he put the lamp on a bracket on the wall and stepping out took my luggage he had carried it in before i could forestall him i protested but he insisted nay sir you are my guest it is late and my people are not available let me see to your comfort myself he insisted on carrying my traps along the passage and then up a great winding stair and along another great passage on whose stone floor our steps rang heavily at the end of this he threw open a heavy door and i rejoiced to see within a well lit room in which a table was spread for supper and on whose mighty hearth a great fire of logs freshly replenished flamed and flared the count halted putting down my bags closed the door and crossing the room opened another door which led into a small octagonal room lit by a single lamp and seemingly without a window of any sort passing through this he opened another door and motioned me to enter it was a welcome sight for here was a great bedroom well lighted and warmed with another log fire also added to but lately for the top logs were fresh which sent a hollow roar up the wide chimney the count himself left my luggage inside and withdrew saying before he closed the door you will need after your journey to refresh yourself by making your toilet i trust you will find all you wish when you are ready come into the other room where you will find your supper prepared the light and warmth and the count s courteous welcome seemed to have dissipated all my doubts and fears having then reached my normal state i discovered that i was half famished with hunger so making a hasty toilet i went into the other room i found supper already laid out my host who stood on one side of the great fireplace leaning against the stonework made a graceful wave of his hand to the table and said i pray you be seated and sup how you please you will i trust excuse me that i do not join you but i have dined already and i do not sup i handed to him the sealed letter which mr hawkins had entrusted to me he opened it and read it gravely then with a charming smile he handed it to me to read one passage of it at least gave me a thrill of pleasure i must regret that an attack of gout from which malady i am a constant sufferer forbids absolutely any travelling on my part for some time to come but i am happy to say i can send a sufficient substitute one in whom i have every possible confidence he is a young man full of energy and talent in his own way and of a very faithful disposition he is discreet and silent and has grown into manhood in my service he shall be ready to attend on you when you will during his stay and shall take your instructions in all matters the count himself came forward and took off the cover of a dish and i fell to at once on an excellent roast chicken this with some cheese and a salad and a bottle of old tokay of which i had two glasses was my supper during the time i was eating it the count asked me many questions as to my journey and i told him by degrees all i had experienced by this time i had finished my supper and by my host s desire had drawn up a chair by the fire and begun to smoke a cigar which he offered me at the same time excusing himself that he did not smoke i had now an opportunity of observing him and found him of a very marked physiognomy his face was a strong a very strong aquiline with high bridge of the thin nose and peculiarly arched nostrils with lofty domed forehead and hair growing scantily round the temples but profusely elsewhere his eyebrows were very massive almost meeting over the nose and with bushy hair that seemed to curl in its own profusion the mouth so far as i could see it under the heavy moustache was fixed and rather cruel looking with peculiarly sharp white teeth these protruded over the lips whose remarkable ruddiness showed astonishing vitality in a man of his years for the rest his ears were pale and at the tops extremely pointed the chin was broad and strong and the cheeks firm though thin the general effect was one of extraordinary pallor hitherto i had noticed the backs of his hands as they lay on his knees in the firelight and they had seemed rather white and fine but seeing them now close to me i could not but notice that they were rather coarse broad with squat fingers strange to say there were hairs in the centre of the palm the nails were long and fine and cut to a sharp point as the count leaned over me and his hands touched me i could not repress a shudder it may have been that his breath was rank but a horrible feeling of nausea came over me which do what i would i could not conceal the count evidently noticing it drew back and with a grim sort of smile which showed more than he had yet done his protuberant teeth sat himself down again on his own side of the fireplace we were both silent for a while and as i looked towards the window i saw the first dim streak of the coming dawn there seemed a strange stillness over everything but as i listened i heard as if from down below in the valley the howling of many wolves the count s eyes gleamed and he said listen to them the children of the night what music they make seeing i suppose some expression in my face strange to him he added ah sir you dwellers in the city cannot enter into the feelings of the hunter then he rose and said but you must be tired your bedroom is all ready and to morrow you shall sleep as late as you will i have to be away till the afternoon so sleep well and dream well with a courteous bow he opened for me himself the door to the octagonal room and i entered my bedroom i am all in a sea of wonders i doubt i fear i think strange things which i dare not confess to my own soul god keep me if only for the sake of those dear to me may it is again early morning but i have rested and enjoyed the last twenty four hours i slept till late in the day and awoke of my own accord when i had dressed myself i went into the room where we had supped and found a cold breakfast laid out with coffee kept hot by the pot being placed on the hearth there was a card on the table on which was written i have to be absent for a while do not wait for me d i set to and enjoyed a hearty meal when i had done i looked for a bell so that i might let the servants know i had finished but i could not find one there are certainly odd deficiencies in the house considering the extraordinary evidences of wealth which are round me the table service is of gold and so beautifully wrought that it must be of immense value the curtains and upholstery of the chairs and sofas and the hangings of my bed are of the costliest and most beautiful fabrics and must have been of fabulous value when they were made for they are centuries old though in excellent order i saw something like them in hampton court but there they were worn and frayed and moth eaten but still in none of the rooms is there a mirror there is not even a toilet glass on my table and i had to get the little shaving glass from my bag before i could either shave or brush my hair i have not yet seen a servant anywhere or heard a sound near the castle except the howling of wolves some time after i had finished my meal i do not know whether to call it breakfast or dinner for it was between five and six o clock when i had it i looked about for something to read for i did not like to go about the castle until i had asked the count s permission there was absolutely nothing in the room book newspaper or even writing materials so i opened another door in the room and found a sort of library the door opposite mine i tried but found it locked in the library i found to my great delight a vast number of english books whole shelves full of them and bound volumes of magazines and newspapers a table in the centre was littered with english magazines and newspapers though none of them were of very recent date the books were of the most varied kind history geography politics political economy botany geology law all relating to england and english life and customs and manners there were even such books of reference as the london directory the red and blue books whitaker s almanac the army and navy lists and it somehow gladdened my heart to see it the law list whilst i was looking at the books the door opened and the count entered he saluted me in a hearty way and hoped that i had had a good night s rest then he went on i am glad you found your way in here for i am sure there is much that will interest you these companions and he laid his hand on some of the books have been good friends to me and for some years past ever since i had the idea of going to london have given me many many hours of pleasure through them i have come to know your great england and to know her is to love her i long to go through the crowded streets of your mighty london to be in the midst of the whirl and rush of humanity to share its life its change its death and all that makes it what it is but alas as yet i only know your tongue through books to you my friend i look that i know it to speak but count i said you know and speak english thoroughly he bowed gravely i thank you my friend for your all too flattering estimate but yet i fear that i am but a little way on the road i would travel true i know the grammar and the words but yet i know not how to speak them indeed i said you speak excellently not so he answered well i know that did i move and speak in your london none there are who would not know me for a stranger that is not enough for me here i am noble i am boyar the common people know me and i am master but a stranger in a strange land he is no one men know him not and to know not is to care not for i am content if i am like the rest so that no man stops if he see me or pause in his speaking if he hear my words ha ha a stranger i have been so long master that i would be master still or at least that none other should be master of me you come to me not alone as agent of my friend peter hawkins of exeter to tell me all about my new estate in london you shall i trust rest here with me awhile so that by our talking i may learn the english intonation and i would that you tell me when i make error even of the smallest in my speaking i am sorry that i had to be away so long to day but you will i know forgive one who has so many important affairs in hand of course i said all i could about being willing and asked if i might come into that room when i chose he answered yes certainly and added you may go anywhere you wish in the castle except where the doors are locked where of course you will not wish to go there is reason that all things are as they are and did you see with my eyes and know with my knowledge you would perhaps better understand i said i was sure of this and then he went on we are in transylvania and transylvania is not england our ways are not your ways and there shall be to you many strange things nay from what you have told me of your experiences already you know something of what strange things there may be this led to much conversation and as it was evident that he wanted to talk if only for talking s sake i asked him many questions regarding things that had already happened to me or come within my notice sometimes he sheered off the subject or turned the conversation by pretending not to understand but generally he answered all i asked most frankly then as time went on and i had got somewhat bolder i asked him of some of the strange things of the preceding night as for instance why the coachman went to the places where he had seen the blue flames he then explained to me that it was commonly believed that on a certain night of the year last night in fact when all evil spirits are supposed to have unchecked sway a blue flame is seen over any place where treasure has been concealed that treasure has been hidden he went on in the region through which you came last night there can be but little doubt for it was the ground fought over for centuries by the wallachian the saxon and the turk why there is hardly a foot of soil in all this region that has not been enriched by the blood of men patriots or invaders in old days there were stirring times when the austrian and the hungarian came up in hordes and the patriots went out to meet them men and women the aged and the children too and waited their coming on the rocks above the passes that they might sweep destruction on them with their artificial avalanches when the invader was triumphant he found but little for whatever there was had been sheltered in the friendly soil but how said i can it have remained so long undiscovered when there is a sure index to it if men will but take the trouble to look the count smiled and as his lips ran back over his gums the long sharp canine teeth showed out strangely he answered because your peasant is at heart a coward and a fool those flames only appear on one night and on that night no man of this land will if he can help it stir without his doors and dear sir even if he did he would not know what to do why even the peasant that you tell me of who marked the place of the flame would not know where to look in daylight even for his own work even you would not i dare be sworn be able to find these places again there you are right i said i know no more than the dead where even to look for them then we drifted into other matters come he said at last tell me of london and of the house which you have procured for me with an apology for my remissness i went into my own room to get the papers from my bag whilst i was placing them in order i heard a rattling of china and silver in the next room and as i passed through noticed that the table had been cleared and the lamp lit for it was by this time deep into the dark the lamps were also lit in the study or library and i found the count lying on the sofa reading of all things in the world an english bradshaw s guide when i came in he cleared the books and papers from the table and with him i went into plans and deeds and figures of all sorts he was interested in everything and asked me a myriad questions about the place and its surroundings he clearly had studied beforehand all he could get on the subject of the neighbourhood for he evidently at the end knew very much more than i did when i remarked this he answered well but my friend is it not needful that i should when i go there i shall be all alone and my friend harker jonathan nay pardon me i fall into my country s habit of putting your patronymic first my friend jonathan harker will not be by my side to correct and aid me he will be in exeter miles away probably working at papers of the law with my other friend peter hawkins so we went thoroughly into the business of the purchase of the estate at purfleet when i had told him the facts and got his signature to the necessary papers and had written a letter with them ready to post to mr hawkins he began to ask me how i had come across so suitable a place i read to him the notes which i had made at the time and which i inscribe here at purfleet on a by road i came across just such a place as seemed to be required and where was displayed a dilapidated notice that the place was for sale it is surrounded by a high wall of ancient structure built of heavy stones and has not been repaired for a large number of years the closed gates are of heavy old oak and iron all eaten with rust the estate is called carfax no doubt a corruption of the old quatre face as the house is four sided agreeing with the cardinal points of the compass it contains in all some twenty acres quite surrounded by the solid stone wall above mentioned there are many trees on it which make it in places gloomy and there is a deep dark looking pond or small lake evidently fed by some springs as the water is clear and flows away in a fair sized stream the house is very large and of all periods back i should say to medi val times for one part is of stone immensely thick with only a few windows high up and heavily barred with iron it looks like part of a keep and is close to an old chapel or church i could not enter it as i had not the key of the door leading to it from the house but i have taken with my kodak views of it from various points the house has been added to but in a very straggling way and i can only guess at the amount of ground it covers which must be very great there are but few houses close at hand one being a very large house only recently added to and formed into a private lunatic asylum it is not however visible from the grounds when i had finished he said i am glad that it is old and big i myself am of an old family and to live in a new house would kill me a house cannot be made habitable in a day and after all how few days go to make up a century i rejoice also that there is a chapel of old times we transylvanian nobles love not to think that our bones may lie amongst the common dead i seek not gaiety nor mirth not the bright voluptuousness of much sunshine and sparkling waters which please the young and gay i am no longer young and my heart through weary years of mourning over the dead is not attuned to mirth moreover the walls of my castle are broken the shadows are many and the wind breathes cold through the broken battlements and casements i love the shade and the shadow and would be alone with my thoughts when i may somehow his words and his look did not seem to accord or else it was that his cast of face made his smile look malignant and saturnine presently with an excuse he left me asking me to put all my papers together he was some little time away and i began to look at some of the books around me one was an atlas which i found opened naturally at england as if that map had been much used on looking at it i found in certain places little rings marked and on examining these i noticed that one was near london on the east side manifestly where his new estate was situated the other two were exeter and whitby on the yorkshire coast it was the better part of an hour when the count returned aha he said still at your books good but you must not work always come i am informed that your supper is ready he took my arm and we went into the next room where i found an excellent supper ready on the table the count again excused himself as he had dined out on his being away from home but he sat as on the previous night and chatted whilst i ate after supper i smoked as on the last evening and the count stayed with me chatting and asking questions on every conceivable subject hour after hour i felt that it was getting very late indeed but i did not say anything for i felt under obligation to meet my host s wishes in every way i was not sleepy as the long sleep yesterday had fortified me but i could not help experiencing that chill which comes over one at the coming of the dawn which is like in its way the turn of the tide they say that people who are near death die generally at the change to the dawn or at the turn of the tide any one who has when tired and tied as it were to his post experienced this change in the atmosphere can well believe it all at once we heard the crow of a cock coming up with preternatural shrillness through the clear morning air count dracula jumping to his feet said why there is the morning again how remiss i am to let you stay up so long you must make your conversation regarding my dear new country of england less interesting so that i may not forget how time flies by us and with a courtly bow he quickly left me i went into my own room and drew the curtains but there was little to notice my window opened into the courtyard all i could see was the warm grey of quickening sky so i pulled the curtains again and have written of this day may i began to fear as i wrote in this book that i was getting too diffuse but now i am glad that i went into detail from the first for there is something so strange about this place and all in it that i cannot but feel uneasy i wish i were safe out of it or that i had never come it may be that this strange night existence is telling on me but would that that were all if there were any one to talk to i could bear it but there is no one i have only the count to speak with and he i fear i am myself the only living soul within the place let me be prosaic so far as facts can be it will help me to bear up and imagination must not run riot with me if it does i am lost let me say at once how i stand or seem to i only slept a few hours when i went to bed and feeling that i could not sleep any more got up i had hung my shaving glass by the window and was just beginning to shave suddenly i felt a hand on my shoulder and heard the count s voice saying to me good morning i started for it amazed me that i had not seen him since the reflection of the glass covered the whole room behind me in starting i had cut myself slightly but did not notice it at the moment having answered the count s salutation i turned to the glass again to see how i had been mistaken this time there could be no error for the man was close to me and i could see him over my shoulder but there was no reflection of him in the mirror the whole room behind me was displayed but there was no sign of a man in it except myself this was startling and coming on the top of so many strange things was beginning to increase that vague feeling of uneasiness which i always have when the count is near but at the instant i saw that the cut had bled a little and the blood was trickling over my chin i laid down the razor turning as i did so half round to look for some sticking plaster when the count saw my face his eyes blazed with a sort of demoniac fury and he suddenly made a grab at my throat i drew away and his hand touched the string of beads which held the crucifix it made an instant change in him for the fury passed so quickly that i could hardly believe that it was ever there take care he said take care how you cut yourself it is more dangerous than you think in this country then seizing the shaving glass he went on and this is the wretched thing that has done the mischief it is a foul bauble of man s vanity away with it and opening the heavy window with one wrench of his terrible hand he flung out the glass which was shattered into a thousand pieces on the stones of the courtyard far below then he withdrew without a word it is very annoying for i do not see how i am to shave unless in my watch case or the bottom of the shaving pot which is fortunately of metal when i went into the dining room breakfast was prepared but i could not find the count anywhere so i breakfasted alone it is strange that as yet i have not seen the count eat or drink he must be a very peculiar man after breakfast i did a little exploring in the castle i went out on the stairs and found a room looking towards the south the view was magnificent and from where i stood there was every opportunity of seeing it the castle is on the very edge of a terrible precipice a stone falling from the window would fall a thousand feet without touching anything as far as the eye can reach is a sea of green tree tops with occasionally a deep rift where there is a chasm here and there are silver threads where the rivers wind in deep gorges through the forests but i am not in heart to describe beauty for when i had seen the view i explored further doors doors doors everywhere and all locked and bolted in no place save from the windows in the castle walls is there an available exit the castle is a veritable prison and i am a prisoner chapter iii jonathan harker s journal continued when i found that i was a prisoner a sort of wild feeling came over me i rushed up and down the stairs trying every door and peering out of every window i could find but after a little the conviction of my helplessness overpowered all other feelings when i look back after a few hours i think i must have been mad for the time for i behaved much as a rat does in a trap when however the conviction had come to me that i was helpless i sat down quietly as quietly as i have ever done anything in my life and began to think over what was best to be done i am thinking still and as yet have come to no definite conclusion of one thing only am i certain that it is no use making my ideas known to the count he knows well that i am imprisoned and as he has done it himself and has doubtless his own motives for it he would only deceive me if i trusted him fully with the facts so far as i can see my only plan will be to keep my knowledge and my fears to myself and my eyes open i am i know either being deceived like a baby by my own fears or else i am in desperate straits and if the latter be so i need and shall need all my brains to get through i had hardly come to this conclusion when i heard the great door below shut and knew that the count had returned he did not come at once into the library so i went cautiously to my own room and found him making the bed this was odd but only confirmed what i had all along thought that there were no servants in the house when later i saw him through the chink of the hinges of the door laying the table in the dining room i was assured of it for if he does himself all these menial offices surely it is proof that there is no one else to do them this gave me a fright for if there is no one else in the castle it must have been the count himself who was the driver of the coach that brought me here this is a terrible thought for if so what does it mean that he could control the wolves as he did by only holding up his hand in silence how was it that all the people at bistritz and on the coach had some terrible fear for me what meant the giving of the crucifix of the garlic of the wild rose of the mountain ash bless that good good woman who hung the crucifix round my neck for it is a comfort and a strength to me whenever i touch it it is odd that a thing which i have been taught to regard with disfavour and as idolatrous should in a time of loneliness and trouble be of help is it that there is something in the essence of the thing itself or that it is a medium a tangible help in conveying memories of sympathy and comfort some time if it may be i must examine this matter and try to make up my mind about it in the meantime i must find out all i can about count dracula as it may help me to understand to night he may talk of himself if i turn the conversation that way i must be very careful however not to awake his suspicion midnight i have had a long talk with the count i asked him a few questions on transylvania history and he warmed up to the subject wonderfully in his speaking of things and people and especially of battles he spoke as if he had been present at them all this he afterwards explained by saying that to a boyar the pride of his house and name is his own pride that their glory is his glory that their fate is his fate whenever he spoke of his house he always said we and spoke almost in the plural like a king speaking i wish i could put down all he said exactly as he said it for to me it was most fascinating it seemed to have in it a whole history of the country he grew excited as he spoke and walked about the room pulling his great white moustache and grasping anything on which he laid his hands as though he would crush it by main strength one thing he said which i shall put down as nearly as i can for it tells in its way the story of his race we szekelys have a right to be proud for in our veins flows the blood of many brave races who fought as the lion fights for lordship here in the whirlpool of european races the ugric tribe bore down from iceland the fighting spirit which thor and wodin gave them which their berserkers displayed to such fell intent on the seaboards of europe ay and of asia and africa too till the peoples thought that the were wolves themselves had come here too when they came they found the huns whose warlike fury had swept the earth like a living flame till the dying peoples held that in their veins ran the blood of those old witches who expelled from scythia had mated with the devils in the desert fools fools what devil or what witch was ever so great as attila whose blood is in these veins he held up his arms is it a wonder that we were a conquering race that we were proud that when the magyar the lombard the avar the bulgar or the turk poured his thousands on our frontiers we drove them back is it strange that when arpad and his legions swept through the hungarian fatherland he found us here when he reached the frontier that the honfoglalas was completed there and when the hungarian flood swept eastward the szekelys were claimed as kindred by the victorious magyars and to us for centuries was trusted the guarding of the frontier of turkey land ay and more than that endless duty of the frontier guard for as the turks say water sleeps and enemy is sleepless who more gladly than we throughout the four nations received the bloody sword or at its warlike call flocked quicker to the standard of the king when was redeemed that great shame of my nation the shame of cassova when the flags of the wallach and the magyar went down beneath the crescent who was it but one of my own race who as voivode crossed the danube and beat the turk on his own ground this was a dracula indeed woe was it that his own unworthy brother when he had fallen sold his people to the turk and brought the shame of slavery on them was it not this dracula indeed who inspired that other of his race who in a later age again and again brought his forces over the great river into turkey land who when he was beaten back came again and again and again though he had to come alone from the bloody field where his troops were being slaughtered since he knew that he alone could ultimately triumph they said that he thought only of himself bah what good are peasants without a leader where ends the war without a brain and heart to conduct it again when after the battle of moh cs we threw off the hungarian yoke we of the dracula blood were amongst their leaders for our spirit would not brook that we were not free ah young sir the szekelys and the dracula as their heart s blood their brains and their swords can boast a record that mushroom growths like the hapsburgs and the romanoffs can never reach the warlike days are over blood is too precious a thing in these days of dishonourable peace and the glories of the great races are as a tale that is told it was by this time close on morning and we went to bed mem this diary seems horribly like the beginning of the arabian nights for everything has to break off at cockcrow or like the ghost of hamlet s father may let me begin with facts bare meagre facts verified by books and figures and of which there can be no doubt i must not confuse them with experiences which will have to rest on my own observation or my memory of them last evening when the count came from his room he began by asking me questions on legal matters and on the doing of certain kinds of business i had spent the day wearily over books and simply to keep my mind occupied went over some of the matters i had been examining at lincoln s inn there was a certain method in the count s inquiries so i shall try to put them down in sequence the knowledge may somehow or some time be useful to me first he asked if a man in england might have two solicitors or more i told him he might have a dozen if he wished but that it would not be wise to have more than one solicitor engaged in one transaction as only one could act at a time and that to change would be certain to militate against his interest he seemed thoroughly to understand and went on to ask if there would be any practical difficulty in having one man to attend say to banking and another to look after shipping in case local help were needed in a place far from the home of the banking solicitor i asked him to explain more fully so that i might not by any chance mislead him so he said i shall illustrate your friend and mine mr peter hawkins from under the shadow of your beautiful cathedral at exeter which is far from london buys for me through your good self my place at london good now here let me say frankly lest you should think it strange that i have sought the services of one so far off from london instead of some one resident there that my motive was that no local interest might be served save my wish only and as one of london residence might perhaps have some purpose of himself or friend to serve i went thus afield to seek my agent whose labours should be only to my interest now suppose i who have much of affairs wish to ship goods say to newcastle or durham or harwich or dover might it not be that it could with more ease be done by consigning to one in these ports i answered that certainly it would be most easy but that we solicitors had a system of agency one for the other so that local work could be done locally on instruction from any solicitor so that the client simply placing himself in the hands of one man could have his wishes carried out by him without further trouble but said he i could be at liberty to direct myself is it not so of course i replied and such is often done by men of business who do not like the whole of their affairs to be known by any one person good he said and then went on to ask about the means of making consignments and the forms to be gone through and of all sorts of difficulties which might arise but by forethought could be guarded against i explained all these things to him to the best of my ability and he certainly left me under the impression that he would have made a wonderful solicitor for there was nothing that he did not think of or foresee for a man who was never in the country and who did not evidently do much in the way of business his knowledge and acumen were wonderful when he had satisfied himself on these points of which he had spoken and i had verified all as well as i could by the books available he suddenly stood up and said have you written since your first letter to our friend mr peter hawkins or to any other it was with some bitterness in my heart that i answered that i had not that as yet i had not seen any opportunity of sending letters to anybody then write now my young friend he said laying a heavy hand on my shoulder write to our friend and to any other and say if it will please you that you shall stay with me until a month from now do you wish me to stay so long i asked for my heart grew cold at the thought i desire it much nay i will take no refusal when your master employer what you will engaged that someone should come on his behalf it was understood that my needs only were to be consulted i have not stinted is it not so what could i do but bow acceptance it was mr hawkins s interest not mine and i had to think of him not myself and besides while count dracula was speaking there was that in his eyes and in his bearing which made me remember that i was a prisoner and that if i wished it i could have no choice the count saw his victory in my bow and his mastery in the trouble of my face for he began at once to use them but in his own smooth resistless way i pray you my good young friend that you will not discourse of things other than business in your letters it will doubtless please your friends to know that you are well and that you look forward to getting home to them is it not so as he spoke he handed me three sheets of note paper and three envelopes they were all of the thinnest foreign post and looking at them then at him and noticing his quiet smile with the sharp canine teeth lying over the red underlip i understood as well as if he had spoken that i should be careful what i wrote for he would be able to read it so i determined to write only formal notes now but to write fully to mr hawkins in secret and also to mina for to her i could write in shorthand which would puzzle the count if he did see it when i had written my two letters i sat quiet reading a book whilst the count wrote several notes referring as he wrote them to some books on his table then he took up my two and placed them with his own and put by his writing materials after which the instant the door had closed behind him i leaned over and looked at the letters which were face down on the table i felt no compunction in doing so for under the circumstances i felt that i should protect myself in every way i could one of the letters was directed to samuel f billington no the crescent whitby another to herr leutner varna the third was to coutts co london and the fourth to herren klopstock billreuth bankers buda pesth the second and fourth were unsealed i was just about to look at them when i saw the door handle move i sank back in my seat having just had time to replace the letters as they had been and to resume my book before the count holding still another letter in his hand entered the room he took up the letters on the table and stamped them carefully and then turning to me said i trust you will forgive me but i have much work to do in private this evening you will i hope find all things as you wish at the door he turned and after a moment s pause said let me advise you my dear young friend nay let me warn you with all seriousness that should you leave these rooms you will not by any chance go to sleep in any other part of the castle it is old and has many memories and there are bad dreams for those who sleep unwisely be warned should sleep now or ever overcome you or be like to do then haste to your own chamber or to these rooms for your rest will then be safe but if you be not careful in this respect then he finished his speech in a gruesome way for he motioned with his hands as if he were washing them i quite understood my only doubt was as to whether any dream could be more terrible than the unnatural horrible net of gloom and mystery which seemed closing around me later i endorse the last words written but this time there is no doubt in question i shall not fear to sleep in any place where he is not i have placed the crucifix over the head of my bed i imagine that my rest is thus freer from dreams and there it shall remain when he left me i went to my room after a little while not hearing any sound i came out and went up the stone stair to where i could look out towards the south there was some sense of freedom in the vast expanse inaccessible though it was to me as compared with the narrow darkness of the courtyard looking out on this i felt that i was indeed in prison and i seemed to want a breath of fresh air though it were of the night i am beginning to feel this nocturnal existence tell on me it is destroying my nerve i start at my own shadow and am full of all sorts of horrible imaginings god knows that there is ground for my terrible fear in this accursed place i looked out over the beautiful expanse bathed in soft yellow moonlight till it was almost as light as day in the soft light the distant hills became melted and the shadows in the valleys and gorges of velvety blackness the mere beauty seemed to cheer me there was peace and comfort in every breath i drew as i leaned from the window my eye was caught by something moving a storey below me and somewhat to my left where i imagined from the order of the rooms that the windows of the count s own room would look out the window at which i stood was tall and deep stone mullioned and though weatherworn was still complete but it was evidently many a day since the case had been there i drew back behind the stonework and looked carefully out what i saw was the count s head coming out from the window i did not see the face but i knew the man by the neck and the movement of his back and arms in any case i could not mistake the hands which i had had so many opportunities of studying i was at first interested and somewhat amused for it is wonderful how small a matter will interest and amuse a man when he is a prisoner but my very feelings changed to repulsion and terror when i saw the whole man slowly emerge from the window and begin to crawl down the castle wall over that dreadful abyss face down with his cloak spreading out around him like great wings at first i could not believe my eyes i thought it was some trick of the moonlight some weird effect of shadow but i kept looking and it could be no delusion i saw the fingers and toes grasp the corners of the stones worn clear of the mortar by the stress of years and by thus using every projection and inequality move downwards with considerable speed just as a lizard moves along a wall what manner of man is this or what manner of creature is it in the semblance of man i feel the dread of this horrible place overpowering me i am in fear in awful fear and there is no escape for me i am encompassed about with terrors that i dare not think of may once more have i seen the count go out in his lizard fashion he moved downwards in a sidelong way some hundred feet down and a good deal to the left he vanished into some hole or window when his head had disappeared i leaned out to try and see more but without avail the distance was too great to allow a proper angle of sight i knew he had left the castle now and thought to use the opportunity to explore more than i had dared to do as yet i went back to the room and taking a lamp tried all the doors they were all locked as i had expected and the locks were comparatively new but i went down the stone stairs to the hall where i had entered originally i found i could pull back the bolts easily enough and unhook the great chains but the door was locked and the key was gone that key must be in the count s room i must watch should his door be unlocked so that i may get it and escape i went on to make a thorough examination of the various stairs and passages and to try the doors that opened from them one or two small rooms near the hall were open but there was nothing to see in them except old furniture dusty with age and moth eaten at last however i found one door at the top of the stairway which though it seemed to be locked gave a little under pressure i tried it harder and found that it was not really locked but that the resistance came from the fact that the hinges had fallen somewhat and the heavy door rested on the floor here was an opportunity which i might not have again so i exerted myself and with many efforts forced it back so that i could enter i was now in a wing of the castle further to the right than the rooms i knew and a storey lower down from the windows i could see that the suite of rooms lay along to the south of the castle the windows of the end room looking out both west and south on the latter side as well as to the former there was a great precipice the castle was built on the corner of a great rock so that on three sides it was quite impregnable and great windows were placed here where sling or bow or culverin could not reach and consequently light and comfort impossible to a position which had to be guarded were secured to the west was a great valley and then rising far away great jagged mountain fastnesses rising peak on peak the sheer rock studded with mountain ash and thorn whose roots clung in cracks and crevices and crannies of the stone this was evidently the portion of the castle occupied by the ladies in bygone days for the furniture had more air of comfort than any i had seen the windows were curtainless and the yellow moonlight flooding in through the diamond panes enabled one to see even colours whilst it softened the wealth of dust which lay over all and disguised in some measure the ravages of time and the moth my lamp seemed to be of little effect in the brilliant moonlight but i was glad to have it with me for there was a dread loneliness in the place which chilled my heart and made my nerves tremble still it was better than living alone in the rooms which i had come to hate from the presence of the count and after trying a little to school my nerves i found a soft quietude come over me here i am sitting at a little oak table where in old times possibly some fair lady sat to pen with much thought and many blushes her ill spelt love letter and writing in my diary in shorthand all that has happened since i closed it last it is nineteenth century up to date with a vengeance and yet unless my senses deceive me the old centuries had and have powers of their own which mere modernity cannot kill later the morning of may god preserve my sanity for to this i am reduced safety and the assurance of safety are things of the past whilst i live on here there is but one thing to hope for that i may not go mad if indeed i be not mad already if i be sane then surely it is maddening to think that of all the foul things that lurk in this hateful place the count is the least dreadful to me that to him alone i can look for safety even though this be only whilst i can serve his purpose great god merciful god let me be calm for out of that way lies madness indeed i begin to get new lights on certain things which have puzzled me up to now i never quite knew what shakespeare meant when he made hamlet say my tablets quick my tablets tis meet that i put it down etc for now feeling as though my own brain were unhinged or as if the shock had come which must end in its undoing i turn to my diary for repose the habit of entering accurately must help to soothe me the count s mysterious warning frightened me at the time it frightens me more now when i think of it for in future he has a fearful hold upon me i shall fear to doubt what he may say when i had written in my diary and had fortunately replaced the book and pen in my pocket i felt sleepy the count s warning came into my mind but i took a pleasure in disobeying it the sense of sleep was upon me and with it the obstinacy which sleep brings as outrider the soft moonlight soothed and the wide expanse without gave a sense of freedom which refreshed me i determined not to return to night to the gloom haunted rooms but to sleep here where of old ladies had sat and sung and lived sweet lives whilst their gentle breasts were sad for their menfolk away in the midst of remorseless wars i drew a great couch out of its place near the corner so that as i lay i could look at the lovely view to east and south and unthinking of and uncaring for the dust composed myself for sleep i suppose i must have fallen asleep i hope so but i fear for all that followed was startlingly real so real that now sitting here in the broad full sunlight of the morning i cannot in the least believe that it was all sleep i was not alone the room was the same unchanged in any way since i came into it i could see along the floor in the brilliant moonlight my own footsteps marked where i had disturbed the long accumulation of dust in the moonlight opposite me were three young women ladies by their dress and manner i thought at the time that i must be dreaming when i saw them for though the moonlight was behind them they threw no shadow on the floor they came close to me and looked at me for some time and then whispered together two were dark and had high aquiline noses like the count and great dark piercing eyes that seemed to be almost red when contrasted with the pale yellow moon the other was fair as fair as can be with great wavy masses of golden hair and eyes like pale sapphires i seemed somehow to know her face and to know it in connection with some dreamy fear but i could not recollect at the moment how or where all three had brilliant white teeth that shone like pearls against the ruby of their voluptuous lips there was something about them that made me uneasy some longing and at the same time some deadly fear i felt in my heart a wicked burning desire that they would kiss me with those red lips it is not good to note this down lest some day it should meet mina s eyes and cause her pain but it is the truth they whispered together and then they all three laughed such a silvery musical laugh but as hard as though the sound never could have come through the softness of human lips it was like the intolerable tingling sweetness of water glasses when played on by a cunning hand the fair girl shook her head coquettishly and the other two urged her on one said go on you are first and we shall follow yours is the right to begin the other added he is young and strong there are kisses for us all i lay quiet looking out under my eyelashes in an agony of delightful anticipation the fair girl advanced and bent over me till i could feel the movement of her breath upon me sweet it was in one sense honey sweet and sent the same tingling through the nerves as her voice but with a bitter underlying the sweet a bitter offensiveness as one smells in blood i was afraid to raise my eyelids but looked out and saw perfectly under the lashes the girl went on her knees and bent over me simply gloating there was a deliberate voluptuousness which was both thrilling and repulsive and as she arched her neck she actually licked her lips like an animal till i could see in the moonlight the moisture shining on the scarlet lips and on the red tongue as it lapped the white sharp teeth lower and lower went her head as the lips went below the range of my mouth and chin and seemed about to fasten on my throat then she paused and i could hear the churning sound of her tongue as it licked her teeth and lips and could feel the hot breath on my neck then the skin of my throat began to tingle as one s flesh does when the hand that is to tickle it approaches nearer nearer i could feel the soft shivering touch of the lips on the super sensitive skin of my throat and the hard dents of two sharp teeth just touching and pausing there i closed my eyes in a languorous ecstasy and waited waited with beating heart but at that instant another sensation swept through me as quick as lightning i was conscious of the presence of the count and of his being as if lapped in a storm of fury as my eyes opened involuntarily i saw his strong hand grasp the slender neck of the fair woman and with giant s power draw it back the blue eyes transformed with fury the white teeth champing with rage and the fair cheeks blazing red with passion but the count never did i imagine such wrath and fury even to the demons of the pit his eyes were positively blazing the red light in them was lurid as if the flames of hell fire blazed behind them his face was deathly pale and the lines of it were hard like drawn wires the thick eyebrows that met over the nose now seemed like a heaving bar of white hot metal with a fierce sweep of his arm he hurled the woman from him and then motioned to the others as though he were beating them back it was the same imperious gesture that i had seen used to the wolves in a voice which though low and almost in a whisper seemed to cut through the air and then ring round the room he said how dare you touch him any of you how dare you cast eyes on him when i had forbidden it back i tell you all this man belongs to me beware how you meddle with him or you ll have to deal with me the fair girl with a laugh of ribald coquetry turned to answer him you yourself never loved you never love on this the other women joined and such a mirthless hard soulless laughter rang through the room that it almost made me faint to hear it seemed like the pleasure of fiends then the count turned after looking at my face attentively and said in a soft whisper yes i too can love you yourselves can tell it from the past is it not so well now i promise you that when i am done with him you shall kiss him at your will now go go i must awaken him for there is work to be done are we to have nothing to night said one of them with a low laugh as she pointed to the bag which he had thrown upon the floor and which moved as though there were some living thing within it for answer he nodded his head one of the women jumped forward and opened it if my ears did not deceive me there was a gasp and a low wail as of a half smothered child the women closed round whilst i was aghast with horror but as i looked they disappeared and with them the dreadful bag there was no door near them and they could not have passed me without my noticing they simply seemed to fade into the rays of the moonlight and pass out through the window for i could see outside the dim shadowy forms for a moment before they entirely faded away then the horror overcame me and i sank down unconscious chapter iv jonathan harker s journal continued i awoke in my own bed if it be that i had not dreamt the count must have carried me here i tried to satisfy myself on the subject but could not arrive at any unquestionable result to be sure there were certain small evidences such as that my clothes were folded and laid by in a manner which was not my habit my watch was still unwound and i am rigorously accustomed to wind it the last thing before going to bed and many such details but these things are no proof for they may have been evidences that my mind was not as usual and from some cause or another i had certainly been much upset i must watch for proof of one thing i am glad if it was that the count carried me here and undressed me he must have been hurried in his task for my pockets are intact i am sure this diary would have been a mystery to him which he would not have brooked he would have taken or destroyed it as i look round this room although it has been to me so full of fear it is now a sort of sanctuary for nothing can be more dreadful than those awful women who were who are waiting to suck my blood may i have been down to look at that room again in daylight for i must know the truth when i got to the doorway at the top of the stairs i found it closed it had been so forcibly driven against the jamb that part of the woodwork was splintered i could see that the bolt of the lock had not been shot but the door is fastened from the inside i fear it was no dream and must act on this surmise may i am surely in the toils last night the count asked me in the suavest tones to write three letters one saying that my work here was nearly done and that i should start for home within a few days another that i was starting on the next morning from the time of the letter and the third that i had left the castle and arrived at bistritz i would fain have rebelled but felt that in the present state of things it would be madness to quarrel openly with the count whilst i am so absolutely in his power and to refuse would be to excite his suspicion and to arouse his anger he knows that i know too much and that i must not live lest i be dangerous to him my only chance is to prolong my opportunities something may occur which will give me a chance to escape i saw in his eyes something of that gathering wrath which was manifest when he hurled that fair woman from him he explained to me that posts were few and uncertain and that my writing now would ensure ease of mind to my friends and he assured me with so much impressiveness that he would countermand the later letters which would be held over at bistritz until due time in case chance would admit of my prolonging my stay that to oppose him would have been to create new suspicion i therefore pretended to fall in with his views and asked him what dates i should put on the letters he calculated a minute and then said the first should be june the second june and the third june i know now the span of my life god help me may there is a chance of escape or at any rate of being able to send word home a band of szgany have come to the castle and are encamped in the courtyard these szgany are gipsies i have notes of them in my book they are peculiar to this part of the world though allied to the ordinary gipsies all the world over there are thousands of them in hungary and transylvania who are almost outside all law they attach themselves as a rule to some great noble or boyar and call themselves by his name they are fearless and without religion save superstition and they talk only their own varieties of the romany tongue i shall write some letters home and shall try to get them to have them posted i have already spoken them through my window to begin acquaintanceship they took their hats off and made obeisance and many signs which however i could not understand any more than i could their spoken language i have written the letters mina s is in shorthand and i simply ask mr hawkins to communicate with her to her i have explained my situation but without the horrors which i may only surmise it would shock and frighten her to death were i to expose my heart to her should the letters not carry then the count shall not yet know my secret or the extent of my knowledge i have given the letters i threw them through the bars of my window with a gold piece and made what signs i could to have them posted the man who took them pressed them to his heart and bowed and then put them in his cap i could do no more i stole back to the study and began to read as the count did not come in i have written here the count has come he sat down beside me and said in his smoothest voice as he opened two letters the szgany has given me these of which though i know not whence they come i shall of course take care see he must have looked at it one is from you and to my friend peter hawkins the other here he caught sight of the strange symbols as he opened the envelope and the dark look came into his face and his eyes blazed wickedly the other is a vile thing an outrage upon friendship and hospitality it is not signed well so it cannot matter to us and he calmly held letter and envelope in the flame of the lamp till they were consumed then he went on the letter to hawkins that i shall of course send on since it is yours your letters are sacred to me your pardon my friend that unknowingly i did break the seal will you not cover it again he held out the letter to me and with a courteous bow handed me a clean envelope i could only redirect it and hand it to him in silence when he went out of the room i could hear the key turn softly a minute later i went over and tried it and the door was locked when an hour or two after the count came quietly into the room his coming awakened me for i had gone to sleep on the sofa he was very courteous and very cheery in his manner and seeing that i had been sleeping he said so my friend you are tired get to bed there is the surest rest i may not have the pleasure to talk to night since there are many labours to me but you will sleep i pray i passed to my room and went to bed and strange to say slept without dreaming despair has its own calms may this morning when i woke i thought i would provide myself with some paper and envelopes from my bag and keep them in my pocket so that i might write in case i should get an opportunity but again a surprise again a shock every scrap of paper was gone and with it all my notes my memoranda relating to railways and travel my letter of credit in fact all that might be useful to me were i once outside the castle i sat and pondered awhile and then some thought occurred to me and i made search of my portmanteau and in the wardrobe where i had placed my clothes the suit in which i had travelled was gone and also my overcoat and rug i could find no trace of them anywhere this looked like some new scheme of villainy june this morning as i was sitting on the edge of my bed cudgelling my brains i heard without a cracking of whips and pounding and scraping of horses feet up the rocky path beyond the courtyard with joy i hurried to the window and saw drive into the yard two great leiter wagons each drawn by eight sturdy horses and at the head of each pair a slovak with his wide hat great nail studded belt dirty sheepskin and high boots they had also their long staves in hand i ran to the door intending to descend and try and join them through the main hall as i thought that way might be opened for them again a shock my door was fastened on the outside then i ran to the window and cried to them they looked up at me stupidly and pointed but just then the hetman of the szgany came out and seeing them pointing to my window said something at which they laughed henceforth no effort of mine no piteous cry or agonised entreaty would make them even look at me they resolutely turned away the leiter wagons contained great square boxes with handles of thick rope these were evidently empty by the ease with which the slovaks handled them and by their resonance as they were roughly moved when they were all unloaded and packed in a great heap in one corner of the yard the slovaks were given some money by the szgany and spitting on it for luck lazily went each to his horse s head shortly afterwards i heard the cracking of their whips die away in the distance june before morning last night the count left me early and locked himself into his own room as soon as i dared i ran up the winding stair and looked out of the window which opened south i thought i would watch for the count for there is something going on the szgany are quartered somewhere in the castle and are doing work of some kind i know it for now and then i hear a far away muffled sound as of mattock and spade and whatever it is it must be the end of some ruthless villainy i had been at the window somewhat less than half an hour when i saw something coming out of the count s window i drew back and watched carefully and saw the whole man emerge it was a new shock to me to find that he had on the suit of clothes which i had worn whilst travelling here and slung over his shoulder the terrible bag which i had seen the women take away there could be no doubt as to his quest and in my garb too this then is his new scheme of evil that he will allow others to see me as they think so that he may both leave evidence that i have been seen in the towns or villages posting my own letters and that any wickedness which he may do shall by the local people be attributed to me it makes me rage to think that this can go on and whilst i am shut up here a veritable prisoner but without that protection of the law which is even a criminal s right and consolation i thought i would watch for the count s return and for a long time sat doggedly at the window then i began to notice that there were some quaint little specks floating in the rays of the moonlight they were like the tiniest grains of dust and they whirled round and gathered in clusters in a nebulous sort of way i watched them with a sense of soothing and a sort of calm stole over me i leaned back in the embrasure in a more comfortable position so that i could enjoy more fully the a rial gambolling something made me start up a low piteous howling of dogs somewhere far below in the valley which was hidden from my sight louder it seemed to ring in my ears and the floating motes of dust to take new shapes to the sound as they danced in the moonlight i felt myself struggling to awake to some call of my instincts nay my very soul was struggling and my half remembered sensibilities were striving to answer the call i was becoming hypnotised quicker and quicker danced the dust the moonbeams seemed to quiver as they went by me into the mass of gloom beyond more and more they gathered till they seemed to take dim phantom shapes and then i started broad awake and in full possession of my senses and ran screaming from the place the phantom shapes which were becoming gradually materialised from the moonbeams were those of the three ghostly women to whom i was doomed i fled and felt somewhat safer in my own room where there was no moonlight and where the lamp was burning brightly when a couple of hours had passed i heard something stirring in the count s room something like a sharp wail quickly suppressed and then there was silence deep awful silence which chilled me with a beating heart i tried the door but i was locked in my prison and could do nothing i sat down and simply cried as i sat i heard a sound in the courtyard without the agonised cry of a woman i rushed to the window and throwing it up peered out between the bars there indeed was a woman with dishevelled hair holding her hands over her heart as one distressed with running she was leaning against a corner of the gateway when she saw my face at the window she threw herself forward and shouted in a voice laden with menace monster give me my child she threw herself on her knees and raising up her hands cried the same words in tones which wrung my heart then she tore her hair and beat her breast and abandoned herself to all the violences of extravagant emotion finally she threw herself forward and though i could not see her i could hear the beating of her naked hands against the door somewhere high overhead probably on the tower i heard the voice of the count calling in his harsh metallic whisper his call seemed to be answered from far and wide by the howling of wolves before many minutes had passed a pack of them poured like a pent up dam when liberated through the wide entrance into the courtyard there was no cry from the woman and the howling of the wolves was but short before long they streamed away singly licking their lips i could not pity her for i knew now what had become of her child and she was better dead what shall i do what can i do how can i escape from this dreadful thing of night and gloom and fear june morning no man knows till he has suffered from the night how sweet and how dear to his heart and eye the morning can be when the sun grew so high this morning that it struck the top of the great gateway opposite my window the high spot which it touched seemed to me as if the dove from the ark had lighted there my fear fell from me as if it had been a vaporous garment which dissolved in the warmth i must take action of some sort whilst the courage of the day is upon me last night one of my post dated letters went to post the first of that fatal series which is to blot out the very traces of my existence from the earth let me not think of it action it has always been at night time that i have been molested or threatened or in some way in danger or in fear i have not yet seen the count in the daylight can it be that he sleeps when others wake that he may be awake whilst they sleep if i could only get into his room but there is no possible way the door is always locked no way for me yes there is a way if one dares to take it where his body has gone why may not another body go i have seen him myself crawl from his window why should not i imitate him and go in by his window the chances are desperate but my need is more desperate still i shall risk it at the worst it can only be death and a man s death is not a calf s and the dreaded hereafter may still be open to me god help me in my task good bye mina if i fail good bye my faithful friend and second father good bye all and last of all mina same day later i have made the effort and god helping me have come safely back to this room i must put down every detail in order i went whilst my courage was fresh straight to the window on the south side and at once got outside on the narrow ledge of stone which runs around the building on this side the stones are big and roughly cut and the mortar has by process of time been washed away between them i took off my boots and ventured out on the desperate way i looked down once so as to make sure that a sudden glimpse of the awful depth would not overcome me but after that kept my eyes away from it i knew pretty well the direction and distance of the count s window and made for it as well as i could having regard to the opportunities available i did not feel dizzy i suppose i was too excited and the time seemed ridiculously short till i found myself standing on the window sill and trying to raise up the sash i was filled with agitation however when i bent down and slid feet foremost in through the window then i looked around for the count but with surprise and gladness made a discovery the room was empty it was barely furnished with odd things which seemed to have never been used the furniture was something the same style as that in the south rooms and was covered with dust i looked for the key but it was not in the lock and i could not find it anywhere the only thing i found was a great heap of gold in one corner gold of all kinds roman and british and austrian and hungarian and greek and turkish money covered with a film of dust as though it had lain long in the ground none of it that i noticed was less than three hundred years old there were also chains and ornaments some jewelled but all of them old and stained at one corner of the room was a heavy door i tried it for since i could not find the key of the room or the key of the outer door which was the main object of my search i must make further examination or all my efforts would be in vain it was open and led through a stone passage to a circular stairway which went steeply down i descended minding carefully where i went for the stairs were dark being only lit by loopholes in the heavy masonry at the bottom there was a dark tunnel like passage through which came a deathly sickly odour the odour of old earth newly turned as i went through the passage the smell grew closer and heavier at last i pulled open a heavy door which stood ajar and found myself in an old ruined chapel which had evidently been used as a graveyard the roof was broken and in two places were steps leading to vaults but the ground had recently been dug over and the earth placed in great wooden boxes manifestly those which had been brought by the slovaks there was nobody about and i made search for any further outlet but there was none then i went over every inch of the ground so as not to lose a chance i went down even into the vaults where the dim light struggled although to do so was a dread to my very soul into two of these i went but saw nothing except fragments of old coffins and piles of dust in the third however i made a discovery there in one of the great boxes of which there were fifty in all on a pile of newly dug earth lay the count he was either dead or asleep i could not say which for the eyes were open and stony but without the glassiness of death and the cheeks had the warmth of life through all their pallor the lips were as red as ever but there was no sign of movement no pulse no breath no beating of the heart i bent over him and tried to find any sign of life but in vain he could not have lain there long for the earthy smell would have passed away in a few hours by the side of the box was its cover pierced with holes here and there i thought he might have the keys on him but when i went to search i saw the dead eyes and in them dead though they were such a look of hate though unconscious of me or my presence that i fled from the place and leaving the count s room by the window crawled again up the castle wall regaining my room i threw myself panting upon the bed and tried to think june to day is the date of my last letter and the count has taken steps to prove that it was genuine for again i saw him leave the castle by the same window and in my clothes as he went down the wall lizard fashion i wished i had a gun or some lethal weapon that i might destroy him but i fear that no weapon wrought alone by man s hand would have any effect on him i dared not wait to see him return for i feared to see those weird sisters i came back to the library and read there till i fell asleep i was awakened by the count who looked at me as grimly as a man can look as he said to morrow my friend we must part you return to your beautiful england i to some work which may have such an end that we may never meet your letter home has been despatched to morrow i shall not be here but all shall be ready for your journey in the morning come the szgany who have some labours of their own here and also come some slovaks when they have gone my carriage shall come for you and shall bear you to the borgo pass to meet the diligence from bukovina to bistritz but i am in hopes that i shall see more of you at castle dracula i suspected him and determined to test his sincerity sincerity it seems like a profanation of the word to write it in connection with such a monster so asked him point blank why may i not go to night because dear sir my coachman and horses are away on a mission but i would walk with pleasure i want to get away at once he smiled such a soft smooth diabolical smile that i knew there was some trick behind his smoothness he said and your baggage i do not care about it i can send for it some other time the count stood up and said with a sweet courtesy which made me rub my eyes it seemed so real you english have a saying which is close to my heart for its spirit is that which rules our boyars welcome the coming speed the parting guest come with me my dear young friend not an hour shall you wait in my house against your will though sad am i at your going and that you so suddenly desire it come with a stately gravity he with the lamp preceded me down the stairs and along the hall suddenly he stopped hark close at hand came the howling of many wolves it was almost as if the sound sprang up at the rising of his hand just as the music of a great orchestra seems to leap under the b ton of the conductor after a pause of a moment he proceeded in his stately way to the door drew back the ponderous bolts unhooked the heavy chains and began to draw it open to my intense astonishment i saw that it was unlocked suspiciously i looked all round but could see no key of any kind as the door began to open the howling of the wolves without grew louder and angrier their red jaws with champing teeth and their blunt clawed feet as they leaped came in through the opening door i knew then that to struggle at the moment against the count was useless with such allies as these at his command i could do nothing but still the door continued slowly to open and only the count s body stood in the gap suddenly it struck me that this might be the moment and means of my doom i was to be given to the wolves and at my own instigation there was a diabolical wickedness in the idea great enough for the count and as a last chance i cried out shut the door i shall wait till morning and covered my face with my hands to hide my tears of bitter disappointment with one sweep of his powerful arm the count threw the door shut and the great bolts clanged and echoed through the hall as they shot back into their places in silence we returned to the library and after a minute or two i went to my own room the last i saw of count dracula was his kissing his hand to me with a red light of triumph in his eyes and with a smile that judas in hell might be proud of when i was in my room and about to lie down i thought i heard a whispering at my door i went to it softly and listened unless my ears deceived me i heard the voice of the count back back to your own place your time is not yet come wait have patience to night is mine to morrow night is yours there was a low sweet ripple of laughter and in a rage i threw open the door and saw without the three terrible women licking their lips as i appeared they all joined in a horrible laugh and ran away i came back to my room and threw myself on my knees it is then so near the end to morrow to morrow lord help me and those to whom i am dear june morning these may be the last words i ever write in this diary i slept till just before the dawn and when i woke threw myself on my knees for i determined that if death came he should find me ready at last i felt that subtle change in the air and knew that the morning had come then came the welcome cock crow and i felt that i was safe with a glad heart i opened my door and ran down to the hall i had seen that the door was unlocked and now escape was before me with hands that trembled with eagerness i unhooked the chains and drew back the massive bolts but the door would not move despair seized me i pulled and pulled at the door and shook it till massive as it was it rattled in its casement i could see the bolt shot it had been locked after i left the count then a wild desire took me to obtain that key at any risk and i determined then and there to scale the wall again and gain the count s room he might kill me but death now seemed the happier choice of evils without a pause i rushed up to the east window and scrambled down the wall as before into the count s room it was empty but that was as i expected i could not see a key anywhere but the heap of gold remained i went through the door in the corner and down the winding stair and along the dark passage to the old chapel i knew now well enough where to find the monster i sought the great box was in the same place close against the wall but the lid was laid on it not fastened down but with the nails ready in their places to be hammered home i knew i must reach the body for the key so i raised the lid and laid it back against the wall and then i saw something which filled my very soul with horror there lay the count but looking as if his youth had been half renewed for the white hair and moustache were changed to dark iron grey the cheeks were fuller and the white skin seemed ruby red underneath the mouth was redder than ever for on the lips were gouts of fresh blood which trickled from the corners of the mouth and ran over the chin and neck even the deep burning eyes seemed set amongst swollen flesh for the lids and pouches underneath were bloated it seemed as if the whole awful creature were simply gorged with blood he lay like a filthy leech exhausted with his repletion i shuddered as i bent over to touch him and every sense in me revolted at the contact but i had to search or i was lost the coming night might see my own body a banquet in a similar way to those horrid three i felt all over the body but no sign could i find of the key then i stopped and looked at the count there was a mocking smile on the bloated face which seemed to drive me mad this was the being i was helping to transfer to london where perhaps for centuries to come he might amongst its teeming millions satiate his lust for blood and create a new and ever widening circle of semi demons to batten on the helpless the very thought drove me mad a terrible desire came upon me to rid the world of such a monster there was no lethal weapon at hand but i seized a shovel which the workmen had been using to fill the cases and lifting it high struck with the edge downward at the hateful face but as i did so the head turned and the eyes fell full upon me with all their blaze of basilisk horror the sight seemed to paralyse me and the shovel turned in my hand and glanced from the face merely making a deep gash above the forehead the shovel fell from my hand across the box and as i pulled it away the flange of the blade caught the edge of the lid which fell over again and hid the horrid thing from my sight the last glimpse i had was of the bloated face blood stained and fixed with a grin of malice which would have held its own in the nethermost hell i thought and thought what should be my next move but my brain seemed on fire and i waited with a despairing feeling growing over me as i waited i heard in the distance a gipsy song sung by merry voices coming closer and through their song the rolling of heavy wheels and the cracking of whips the szgany and the slovaks of whom the count had spoken were coming with a last look around and at the box which contained the vile body i ran from the place and gained the count s room determined to rush out at the moment the door should be opened with strained ears i listened and heard downstairs the grinding of the key in the great lock and the falling back of the heavy door there must have been some other means of entry or some one had a key for one of the locked doors then there came the sound of many feet tramping and dying away in some passage which sent up a clanging echo i turned to run down again towards the vault where i might find the new entrance but at the moment there seemed to come a violent puff of wind and the door to the winding stair blew to with a shock that set the dust from the lintels flying when i ran to push it open i found that it was hopelessly fast i was again a prisoner and the net of doom was closing round me more closely as i write there is in the passage below a sound of many tramping feet and the crash of weights being set down heavily doubtless the boxes with their freight of earth there is a sound of hammering it is the box being nailed down now i can hear the heavy feet tramping again along the hall with many other idle feet coming behind them the door is shut and the chains rattle there is a grinding of the key in the lock i can hear the key withdraw then another door opens and shuts i hear the creaking of lock and bolt hark in the courtyard and down the rocky way the roll of heavy wheels the crack of whips and the chorus of the szgany as they pass into the distance i am alone in the castle with those awful women faugh mina is a woman and there is nought in common they are devils of the pit i shall not remain alone with them i shall try to scale the castle wall farther than i have yet attempted i shall take some of the gold with me lest i want it later i may find a way from this dreadful place and then away for home away to the quickest and nearest train away from this cursed spot from this cursed land where the devil and his children still walk with earthly feet at least god s mercy is better than that of these monsters and the precipice is steep and high at its foot a man may sleep as a man good bye all mina chapter v letter from miss mina murray to miss lucy westenra may my dearest lucy forgive my long delay in writing but i have been simply overwhelmed with work the life of an assistant schoolmistress is sometimes trying i am longing to be with you and by the sea where we can talk together freely and build our castles in the air i have been working very hard lately because i want to keep up with jonathan s studies and i have been practising shorthand very assiduously when we are married i shall be able to be useful to jonathan and if i can stenograph well enough i can take down what he wants to say in this way and write it out for him on the typewriter at which also i am practising very hard he and i sometimes write letters in shorthand and he is keeping a stenographic journal of his travels abroad when i am with you i shall keep a diary in the same way i don t mean one of those two pages to the week with sunday squeezed in a corner diaries but a sort of journal which i can write in whenever i feel inclined i do not suppose there will be much of interest to other people but it is not intended for them i may show it to jonathan some day if there is in it anything worth sharing but it is really an exercise book i shall try to do what i see lady journalists do interviewing and writing descriptions and trying to remember conversations i am told that with a little practice one can remember all that goes on or that one hears said during a day however we shall see i will tell you of my little plans when we meet i have just had a few hurried lines from jonathan from transylvania he is well and will be returning in about a week i am longing to hear all his news it must be so nice to see strange countries i wonder if we i mean jonathan and i shall ever see them together there is the ten o clock bell ringing good bye your loving mina tell me all the news when you write you have not told me anything for a long time i hear rumours and especially of a tall handsome curly haired man letter lucy westenra to mina murray chatham street wednesday my dearest mina i must say you tax me very unfairly with being a bad correspondent i wrote to you twice since we parted and your last letter was only your second besides i have nothing to tell you there is really nothing to interest you town is very pleasant just now and we go a good deal to picture galleries and for walks and rides in the park as to the tall curly haired man i suppose it was the one who was with me at the last pop some one has evidently been telling tales that was mr holmwood he often comes to see us and he and mamma get on very well together they have so many things to talk about in common we met some time ago a man that would just do for you if you were not already engaged to jonathan he is an excellent parti being handsome well off and of good birth he is a doctor and really clever just fancy he is only nine and twenty and he has an immense lunatic asylum all under his own care mr holmwood introduced him to me and he called here to see us and often comes now i think he is one of the most resolute men i ever saw and yet the most calm he seems absolutely imperturbable i can fancy what a wonderful power he must have over his patients he has a curious habit of looking one straight in the face as if trying to read one s thoughts he tries this on very much with me but i flatter myself he has got a tough nut to crack i know that from my glass do you ever try to read your own face i do and i can tell you it is not a bad study and gives you more trouble than you can well fancy if you have never tried it he says that i afford him a curious psychological study and i humbly think i do i do not as you know take sufficient interest in dress to be able to describe the new fashions dress is a bore that is slang again but never mind arthur says that every day there it is all out mina we have told all our secrets to each other since we were children we have slept together and eaten together and laughed and cried together and now though i have spoken i would like to speak more oh mina couldn t you guess i love him i am blushing as i write

sympathy my dear it never rains but it pours how true the old proverbs are here am i who shall be twenty in september and yet i never had a proposal till to day not a real proposal and to day i have had three just fancy three proposals in one day isn t it awful i feel sorry really and truly sorry for two of the poor fellows oh mina i am so happy that i don t know what to do with myself and three proposals but for goodness sake don t tell any of the girls or they would be getting all sorts of extravagant ideas and imagining themselves injured and slighted if in their very first day at home they did not get six at least some girls are so vain you and i mina dear who are engaged and are going to settle down soon soberly into old married women can despise vanity well i must tell you about the three but you must keep it a secret dear from every one except of course jonathan you will tell him because i would if i were in your place certainly tell arthur a woman ought to tell her husband everything don t you think so dear and i must be fair men like women certainly their wives to be quite as fair as they are and women i am afraid are not always quite as fair as they should be well my dear number one came just before lunch i told you of him dr john seward the lunatic asylum man with the strong jaw and the good forehead he was very cool outwardly but was nervous all the same he had evidently been schooling himself as to all sorts of little things and remembered them but he almost managed to sit down on his silk hat which men don t generally do when they are cool and then when he wanted to appear at ease he kept playing with a lancet in a way that made me nearly scream he spoke to me mina very straightforwardly he told me how dear i was to him though he had known me so little and what his life would be with me to help and cheer him he was going to tell me how unhappy he would be if i did not care for him but when he saw me cry he said that he was a brute and would not add to my present trouble then he broke off and asked if i could love him in time and when i shook my head his hands trembled and then with some hesitation he asked me if i cared already for any one else he put it very nicely saying that he did not want to wring my confidence from me but only to know because if a woman s heart was free a man might have hope and then mina i felt a sort of duty to tell him that there was some one i only told him that much and then he stood up and he looked very strong and very grave as he took both my hands in his and said he hoped i would be happy and that if i ever wanted a friend i must count him one of my best oh mina dear i can t help crying and you must excuse this letter being all blotted being proposed to is all very nice and all that sort of thing but it isn t at all a happy thing when you have to see a poor fellow whom you know loves you honestly going away and looking all broken hearted and to know that no matter what he may say at the moment you are passing quite out of his life my dear i must stop here at present i feel so miserable though i am so happy evening arthur has just gone and i feel in better spirits than when i left off so i can go on telling you about the day well my dear number two came after lunch he is such a nice fellow an american from texas and he looks so young and so fresh that it seems almost impossible that he has been to so many places and has had such adventures i sympathise with poor desdemona when she had such a dangerous stream poured in her ear even by a black man i suppose that we women are such cowards that we think a man will save us from fears and we marry him i know now what i would do if i were a man and wanted to make a girl love me no i don t for there was mr morris telling us his stories and arthur never told any and yet my dear i am somewhat previous mr quincey p morris found me alone it seems that a man always does find a girl alone no he doesn t for arthur tried twice to make a chance and i helping him all i could i am not ashamed to say it now i must tell you beforehand that mr morris doesn t always speak slang that is to say he never does so to strangers or before them for he is really well educated and has exquisite manners but he found out that it amused me to hear him talk american slang and whenever i was present and there was no one to be shocked he said such funny things i am afraid my dear he has to invent it all for it fits exactly into whatever else he has to say but this is a way slang has i do not know myself if i shall ever speak slang i do not know if arthur likes it as i have never heard him use any as yet well mr morris sat down beside me and looked as happy and jolly as he could but i could see all the same that he was very nervous he took my hand in his and said ever so sweetly miss lucy i know i ain t good enough to regulate the fixin s of your little shoes but i guess if you wait till you find a man that is you will go join them seven young women with the lamps when you quit won t you just hitch up alongside of me and let us go down the long road together driving in double harness well he did look so good humoured and so jolly that it didn t seem half so hard to refuse him as it did poor dr seward so i said as lightly as i could that i did not know anything of hitching and that i wasn t broken to harness at all yet then he said that he had spoken in a light manner and he hoped that if he had made a mistake in doing so on so grave so momentous an occasion for him i would forgive him he really did look serious when he was saying it and i couldn t help feeling a bit serious too i know mina you will think me a horrid flirt though i couldn t help feeling a sort of exultation that he was number two in one day and then my dear before i could say a word he began pouring out a perfect torrent of love making laying his very heart and soul at my feet he looked so earnest over it that i shall never again think that a man must be playful always and never earnest because he is merry at times i suppose he saw something in my face which checked him for he suddenly stopped and said with a sort of manly fervour that i could have loved him for if i had been free lucy you are an honest hearted girl i know i should not be here speaking to you as i am now if i did not believe you clean grit right through to the very depths of your soul tell me like one good fellow to another is there any one else that you care for and if there is i ll never trouble you a hair s breadth again but will be if you will let me a very faithful friend my dear mina why are men so noble when we women are so little worthy of them here was i almost making fun of this great hearted true gentleman i burst into tears i am afraid my dear you will think this a very sloppy letter in more ways than one and i really felt very badly why can t they let a girl marry three men or as many as want her and save all this trouble but this is heresy and i must not say it i am glad to say that though i was crying i was able to look into mr morris s brave eyes and i told him out straight yes there is some one i love though he has not told me yet that he even loves me i was right to speak to him so frankly for quite a light came into his face and he put out both his hands and took mine i think i put them into his and said in a hearty way that s my brave girl it s better worth being late for a chance of winning you than being in time for any other girl in the world don t cry my dear if it s for me i m a hard nut to crack and i take it standing up if that other fellow doesn t know his happiness well he d better look for it soon or he ll have to deal with me little girl your honesty and pluck have made me a friend and that s rarer than a lover it s more unselfish anyhow my dear i m going to have a pretty lonely walk between this and kingdom come won t you give me one kiss it ll be something to keep off the darkness now and then you can you know if you like for that other good fellow he must be a good fellow my dear and a fine fellow or you could not love him hasn t spoken yet that quite won me mina for it was brave and sweet of him and noble too to a rival wasn t it and he so sad so i leant over and kissed him he stood up with my two hands in his and as he looked down into my face i am afraid i was blushing very much he said little girl i hold your hand and you ve kissed me and if these things don t make us friends nothing ever will thank you for your sweet honesty to me and good bye he wrung my hand and taking up his hat went straight out of the room without looking back without a tear or a quiver or a pause and i am crying like a baby oh why must a man like that be made unhappy when there are lots of girls about who would worship the very ground he trod on i know i would if i were free only i don t want to be free my dear this quite upset me and i feel i cannot write of happiness just at once after telling you of it and i don t wish to tell of the number three until it can be all happy ever your loving lucy p s oh about number three i needn t tell you of number three need i besides it was all so confused it seemed only a moment from his coming into the room till both his arms were round me and he was kissing me i am very very happy and i don t know what i have done to deserve it i must only try in the future to show that i am not ungrateful to god for all his goodness to me in sending to me such a lover such a husband and such a friend good bye dr seward s diary kept in phonograph may ebb tide in appetite to day cannot eat cannot rest so diary instead since my rebuff of yesterday i have a sort of empty feeling nothing in the world seems of sufficient importance to be worth the doing as i knew that the only cure for this sort of thing was work i went down amongst the patients i picked out one who has afforded me a study of much interest he is so quaint that i am determined to understand him as well as i can to day i seemed to get nearer than ever before to the heart of his mystery i questioned him more fully than i had ever done with a view to making myself master of the facts of his hallucination in my manner of doing it there was i now see something of cruelty i seemed to wish to keep him to the point of his madness a thing which i avoid with the patients as i would the mouth of hell mem under what circumstances would i not avoid the pit of hell omnia rom venalia sunt hell has its price verb sap if there be anything behind this instinct it will be valuable

p morris may count me in every time i bear messages which will make both your ears tingle art chapter vi mina murray s journal july whitby lucy met me at the station looking sweeter and lovelier than ever and we drove up to the house at the crescent in which they have rooms this is a lovely place the little river the esk runs through a deep valley which broadens out as it comes near the harbour a great viaduct runs across with high piers through which the view seems somehow further away than it really is the valley is beautifully green and it is so steep that when you are on the high land on either side you look right across it unless you are near enough to see down the houses of the old town the side away from us are all red roofed and seem piled up one over the other anyhow like the pictures we see of nuremberg right over the town is the ruin of whitby abbey which was sacked by the danes and which is the scene of part of marmion where the girl was built up in the wall it is a most noble ruin of immense size and full of beautiful and romantic bits there is a legend that a white lady is seen in one of the windows between it and the town there is another church the parish one round which is a big graveyard all full of tombstones this is to my mind the nicest spot in whitby for it lies right over the town and has a full view of the harbour and all up the bay to where the headland called kettleness stretches out into the sea it descends so steeply over the harbour that part of the bank has fallen away and some of the graves have been destroyed in one place part of the stonework of the graves stretches out over the sandy pathway far below there are walks with seats beside them through the churchyard and people go and sit there all day long looking at the beautiful view and enjoying the breeze i shall come and sit here very often myself and work indeed i am writing now with my book on my knee and listening to the talk of three old men who are sitting beside me they seem to do nothing all day but sit up here and talk the harbour lies below me with on the far side one long granite wall stretching out into the sea with a curve outwards at the end of it in the middle of which is a lighthouse a heavy sea wall runs along outside of it on the near side the sea wall makes an elbow crooked inversely and its end too has a lighthouse between the two piers there is a narrow opening into the harbour which then suddenly widens it is nice at high water but when the tide is out it shoals away to nothing and there is merely the stream of the esk running between banks of sand with rocks here and there outside the harbour on this side there rises for about half a mile a great reef the sharp edge of which runs straight out from behind the south lighthouse at the end of it is a buoy with a bell which swings in bad weather and sends in a mournful sound on the wind they have a legend here that when a ship is lost bells are heard out at sea i must ask the old man about this he is coming this way he is a funny old man he must be awfully old for his face is all gnarled and twisted like the bark of a tree he tells me that he is nearly a hundred and that he was a sailor in the greenland fishing fleet when waterloo was fought he is i am afraid a very sceptical person for when i asked him about the bells at sea and the white lady at the abbey he said very brusquely i wouldn t fash masel about them miss them things be all wore out mind i don t say that they never was but i do say that they wasn t in my time they be all very well for comers and trippers an the like but not for a nice young lady like you them feet folks from york and leeds that be always eatin cured herrin s an drinkin tea an lookin out to buy cheap jet would creed aught i wonder masel who d be bothered tellin lies to them even the newspapers which is full of fool talk i thought he would be a good person to learn interesting things from so i asked him if he would mind telling me something about the whale fishing in the old days he was just settling himself to begin when the clock struck six whereupon he laboured to get up and said i must gang ageeanwards home now miss my grand daughter doesn t like to be kept waitin when the tea is ready for it takes me time to crammle aboon the grees for there be a many of em an miss i lack belly timber sairly by the clock he hobbled away and i could see him hurrying as well as he could down the steps the steps are a great feature on the place they lead from the town up to the church there are hundreds of them i do not know how many and they wind up in a delicate curve the slope is so gentle that a horse could easily walk up and down them i think they must originally have had something to do with the abbey i shall go home too lucy went out visiting with her mother and as they were only duty calls i did not go they will be home by this august i came up here an hour ago with lucy and we had a most interesting talk with my old friend and the two others who always come and join him he is evidently the sir oracle of them and i should think must have been in his time a most dictatorial person he will not admit anything and downfaces everybody if he can t out argue them he bullies them and then takes their silence for agreement with his views lucy was looking sweetly pretty in her white lawn frock she has got a beautiful colour since she has been here i noticed that the old men did not lose any time in coming up and sitting near her when we sat down she is so sweet with old people i think they all fell in love with her on the spot even my old man succumbed and did not contradict her but gave me double share instead i got him on the subject of the legends and he went off at once into a sort of sermon i must try to remember it and put it down it be all fool talk lock stock and barrel that s what it be an nowt else these bans an wafts an boh ghosts an barguests an bogles an all anent them is only fit to set bairns an dizzy women a belderin they be nowt but air blebs they an all grims an signs an warnin s be all invented by parsons an illsome beuk bodies an railway touters to skeer an scunner hafflin s an to get folks to do somethin that they don t other incline to it makes me ireful to think o them why it s them that not content with printin lies on paper an preachin them out of pulpits does want to be cuttin them on the tombstones look here all around you in what airt ye will all them steans holdin up their heads as well as they can out of their pride is acant simply tumblin down with the weight o the lies wrote on them here lies the body or sacred to the memory wrote on all of them an yet in nigh half of them there bean t no bodies at all an the memories of them bean t cared a pinch of snuff about much less sacred lies all of them nothin but lies of one kind or another my gog but it ll be a quare scowderment at the day of judgment when they come tumblin up in their death sarks all jouped together an tryin to drag their tombsteans with them to prove how good they was some of them trimmlin and ditherin with their hands that dozzened an slippy from lyin in the sea that they can t even keep their grup o them i could see from the old fellow s self satisfied air and the way in which he looked round for the approval of his cronies that he was showing off so i put in a word to keep him going oh mr swales you can t be serious surely these tombstones are not all wrong yabblins there may be a poorish few not wrong savin where they make out the people too good for there be folk that do think a balm bowl be like the sea if only it be their own the whole thing be only lies now look you here you come here a stranger an you see this kirk garth i nodded for i thought it better to assent though i did not quite understand his dialect i knew it had something to do with the church he went on and you consate that all these steans be aboon folk that be happed here snod an snog i assented again then that be just where the lie comes in why there be scores of these lay beds that be toom as old dun s bacca box on friday night he nudged one of his companions and they all laughed and my gog how could they be otherwise look at that one the aftest abaft the bier bank read it i went over and read edward spencelagh master mariner murdered by pirates off the coast of andres april t when i came back mr swales went on who brought him home i wonder to hap him here murdered off the coast of andres an you consated his body lay under why i could name ye a dozen whose bones lie in the greenland seas above he pointed northwards or where the currents may have drifted them there be the steans around ye ye can with your young eyes read the small print of the lies from here this braithwaite lowrey i knew his father lost in the lively off greenland in or andrew woodhouse drowned in the same seas in or john paxton drowned off cape farewell a year later or old john rawlings whose grandfather sailed with me drowned in the gulf of finland in do ye think that all these men will have to make a rush to whitby when the trumpet sounds i have me antherums aboot it i tell ye that when they got here they d be jommlin an jostlin one another that way that it ud be like a fight up on the ice in the old days when we d be at one another from daylight to dark an tryin to tie up our cuts by the light of the aurora borealis this was evidently local pleasantry for the old man cackled over it and his cronies joined in with gusto but i said surely you are not quite correct for you start on the assumption that all the poor people or their spirits will have to take their tombstones with them on the day of judgment do you think that will be really necessary well what else be they tombstones for answer me that miss to please their relatives i suppose to please their relatives you suppose this he said with intense scorn how will it pleasure their relatives to know that lies is wrote over them and that everybody in the place knows that they be lies he pointed to a stone at our feet which had been laid down as a slab on which the seat was rested close to the edge of the cliff read the lies on that thruff stean he said the letters were upside down to me from where i sat but lucy was more opposite to them so she leant over and read sacred to the memory of george canon who died in the hope of a glorious resurrection on july falling from the rocks at kettleness this tomb was erected by his sorrowing mother to her dearly beloved son he was the only son of his mother and she was a widow really mr swales i don t see anything very funny in that she spoke her comment very gravely and somewhat severely ye don t see aught funny ha ha but that s because ye don t gawm the sorrowin mother was a hell cat that hated him because he was acrewk d a regular lamiter he was an he hated her so that he committed suicide in order that she mightn t get an insurance she put on his life he blew nigh the top of his head off with an old musket that they had for scarin the crows with twarn t for crows then for it brought the clegs and the dowps to him that s the way he fell off the rocks and as to hopes of a glorious resurrection i ve often heard him say masel that he hoped he d go to hell for his mother was so pious that she d be sure to go to heaven an he didn t want to addle where she was now isn t that stean at any rate he hammered it with his stick as he spoke a pack of lies and won t it make gabriel keckle when geordie comes pantin up the grees with the tombstean balanced on his hump and asks it to be took as evidence i did not know what to say but lucy turned the conversation as she said rising up oh why did you tell us of this it is my favourite seat and i cannot leave it and now i find i must go on sitting over the grave of a suicide that won t harm ye my pretty an it may make poor geordie gladsome to have so trim a lass sittin on his lap that won t hurt ye why i ve sat here off an on for nigh twenty years past an it hasn t done me no harm don t ye fash about them as lies under ye or that doesn lie there either it ll be time for ye to be getting scart when ye see the tombsteans all run away with and the place as bare as a stubble field there s the clock an i must gang my service to ye ladies and off he hobbled lucy and i sat awhile and it was all so beautiful before us that we took hands as we sat and she told me all over again about arthur and their coming marriage that made me just a little heart sick for i haven t heard from jonathan for a whole month the same day i came up here alone for i am very sad there was no letter for me i hope there cannot be anything the matter with jonathan the clock has just struck nine i see the lights scattered all over the town sometimes in rows where the streets are and sometimes singly they run right up the esk and die away in the curve of the valley to my left the view is cut off by a black line of roof of the old house next the abbey the sheep and lambs are bleating in the fields away behind me and there is a clatter of a donkey s hoofs up the paved road below the band on the pier is playing a harsh waltz in good time and further along the quay there is a salvation army meeting in a back street neither of the bands hears the other but up here i hear and see them both i wonder where jonathan is and if he is thinking of me i wish he were here dr seward s diary june the case of renfield grows more interesting the more i get to understand the man he has certain qualities very largely developed selfishness secrecy and purpose i wish i could get at what is the object of the latter he seems to have some settled scheme of his own but what it is i do not yet know his redeeming quality is a love of animals though indeed he has such curious turns in it that i sometimes imagine he is only abnormally cruel his pets are of odd sorts just now his hobby is catching flies he has at present such a quantity that i have had myself to expostulate to my astonishment he did not break out into a fury as i expected but took the matter in simple seriousness he thought for a moment and then said may i have three days i shall clear them away of course i said that would do i must watch him june he has turned his mind now to spiders and has got several very big fellows in a box he keeps feeding them with his flies and the number of the latter is becoming sensibly diminished although he has used half his food in attracting more flies from outside to his room july his spiders are now becoming as great a nuisance as his flies and to day i told him that he must get rid of them he looked very sad at this so i said that he must clear out some of them at all events he cheerfully acquiesced in this and i gave him the same time as before for reduction he disgusted me much while with him for when a horrid blow fly bloated with some carrion food buzzed into the room he caught it held it exultantly for a few moments between his finger and thumb and before i knew what he was going to do put it in his mouth and ate it i scolded him for it but he argued quietly that it was very good and very wholesome that it was life strong life and gave life to him this gave me an idea or the rudiment of one i must watch how he gets rid of his spiders he has evidently some deep problem in his mind for he keeps a little note book in which he is always jotting down something whole pages of it are filled with masses of figures generally single numbers added up in batches and then the totals added in batches again as though he were focussing some account as the auditors put it july there is a method in his madness and the rudimentary idea in my mind is growing it will be a whole idea soon and then oh unconscious cerebration you will have to give the wall to your conscious brother i kept away from my friend for a few days so that i might notice if there were any change things remain as they were except that he has parted with some of his pets and got a new one he has managed to get a sparrow and has already partially tamed it his means of taming is simple for already the spiders have diminished those that do remain however are well fed for he still brings in the flies by tempting them with his food july we are progressing my friend has now a whole colony of sparrows and his flies and spiders are almost obliterated when i came in he ran to me and said he wanted to ask me a great favour a very very great favour and as he spoke he fawned on me like a dog i asked him what it was and he said with a sort of rapture in his voice and bearing a kitten a nice little sleek playful kitten that i can play with and teach and feed and feed and feed i was not unprepared for this request for i had noticed how his pets went on increasing in size and vivacity but i did not care that his pretty family of tame sparrows should be wiped out in the same manner as the flies and the spiders so i said i would see about it and asked him if he would not rather have a cat than a kitten his eagerness betrayed him as he answered oh yes i would like a cat i only asked for a kitten lest you should refuse me a cat no one would refuse me a kitten would they i shook my head and said that at present i feared it would not be possible but that i would see about it his face fell and i could see a warning of danger in it for there was a sudden fierce sidelong look which meant killing the man is an undeveloped homicidal maniac i shall test him with his present craving and see how it will work out then i shall know more p m i have visited him again and found him sitting in a corner brooding when i came in he threw himself on his knees before me and implored me to let him have a cat that his salvation depended upon it i was firm however and told him that he could not have it whereupon he went without a word and sat down gnawing his fingers in the corner where i had found him i shall see him in the morning early july visited renfield very early before the attendant went his rounds found him up and humming a tune he was spreading out his sugar which he had saved in the window and was manifestly beginning his fly catching again and beginning it cheerfully and with a good grace i looked around for his birds and not seeing them asked him where they were he replied without turning round that they had all flown away there were a few feathers about the room and on his pillow a drop of blood i said nothing but went and told the keeper to report to me if there were anything odd about him during the day a m the attendant has just been to me to say that renfield has been very sick and has disgorged a whole lot of feathers my belief is doctor he said that he has eaten his birds and that he just took and ate them raw p m i gave renfield a strong opiate to night enough to make even him sleep and took away his pocket book to look at it the thought that has been buzzing about my brain lately is complete and the theory proved my homicidal maniac is of a peculiar kind i shall have to invent a new classification for him and call him a zo phagous life eating maniac what he desires is to absorb as many lives as he can and he has laid himself out to achieve it in a cumulative way he gave many flies to one spider and many spiders to one bird and then wanted a cat to eat the many birds what would have been his later steps it would almost be worth while to complete the experiment it might be done if there were only a sufficient cause men sneered at vivisection and yet look at its results to day why not advance science in its most difficult and vital aspect the knowledge of the brain had i even the secret of one such mind did i hold the key to the fancy of even one lunatic i might advance my own branch of science to a pitch compared with which burdon sanderson s physiology or ferrier s brain knowledge would be as nothing if only there were a sufficient cause i must not think too much of this or i may be tempted a good cause might turn the scale with me for may not i too be of an exceptional brain congenitally how well the man reasoned lunatics always do within their own scope i wonder at how many lives he values a man or if at only one he has closed the account most accurately and to day begun a new record how many of us begin a new record with each day of our lives to me it seems only yesterday that my whole life ended with my new hope and that truly i began a new record so it will be until the great recorder sums me up and closes my ledger account with a balance to profit or loss oh lucy lucy i cannot be angry with you nor can i be angry with my friend whose happiness is yours but i must only wait on hopeless and work work work if i only could have as strong a cause as my poor mad friend there a good unselfish cause to make me work that would be indeed happiness mina murray s journal july i am anxious and it soothes me to express myself here it is like whispering to one s self and listening at the same time and there is also something about the shorthand symbols that makes it different from writing i am unhappy about lucy and about jonathan i had not heard from jonathan for some time and was very concerned but yesterday dear mr hawkins who is always so kind sent me a letter from him i had written asking him if he had heard and he said the enclosed had just been received it is only a line dated from castle dracula and says that he is just starting for home that is not like jonathan i do not understand it and it makes me uneasy then too lucy although she is so well has lately taken to her old habit of walking in her sleep her mother has spoken to me about it and we have decided that i am to lock the door of our room every night mrs westenra has got an idea that sleep walkers always go out on roofs of houses and along the edges of cliffs and then get suddenly wakened and fall over with a despairing cry that echoes all over the place poor dear she is naturally anxious about lucy and she tells me that her husband lucy s father had the same habit that he would get up in the night and dress himself and go out if he were not stopped lucy is to be married in the autumn and she is already planning out her dresses and how her house is to be arranged i sympathise with her for i do the same only jonathan and i will start in life in a very simple way and shall have to try to make both ends meet mr holmwood he is the hon arthur holmwood only son of lord godalming is coming up here very shortly as soon as he can leave town for his father is not very well and i think dear lucy is counting the moments till he comes she wants to take him up to the seat on the churchyard cliff and show him the beauty of whitby i daresay it is the waiting which disturbs her she will be all right when he arrives july no news from jonathan i am getting quite uneasy about him though why i should i do not know but i do wish that he would write if it were only a single line lucy walks more than ever and each night i am awakened by her moving about the room fortunately the weather is so hot that she cannot get cold but still the anxiety and the perpetually being wakened is beginning to tell on me and i am getting nervous and wakeful myself thank god lucy s health keeps up mr holmwood has been suddenly called to ring to see his father who has been taken seriously ill lucy frets at the postponement of seeing him but it does not touch her looks she is a trifle stouter and her cheeks are a lovely rose pink she has lost that an mic look which she had i pray it will all last august another week gone and no news from jonathan not even to mr hawkins from whom i have heard oh i do hope he is not ill he surely would have written i look at that last letter of his but somehow it does not satisfy me it does not read like him and yet it is his writing there is no mistake of that lucy has not walked much in her sleep the last week but there is an odd concentration about her which i do not understand even in her sleep she seems to be watching me she tries the door and finding it locked goes about the room searching for the key august another three days and no news this suspense is getting dreadful if i only knew where to write to or where to go to i should feel easier but no one has heard a word of jonathan since that last letter i must only pray to god for patience lucy is more excitable than ever but is otherwise well last night was very threatening and the fishermen say that we are in for a storm i must try to watch it and learn the weather signs to day is a grey day and the sun as i write is hidden in thick clouds high over kettleness everything is grey except the green grass which seems like emerald amongst it grey earthy rock grey clouds tinged with the sunburst at the far edge hang over the grey sea into which the sand points stretch like grey fingers the sea is tumbling in over the shallows and the sandy flats with a roar muffled in the sea mists drifting inland the horizon is lost in a grey mist all is vastness the clouds are piled up like giant rocks and there is a brool over the sea that sounds like some presage of doom dark figures are on the beach here and there sometimes half shrouded in the mist and seem men like trees walking the fishing boats are racing for home and rise and dip in the ground swell as they sweep into the harbour bending to the scuppers here comes old mr swales he is making straight for me and i can see by the way he lifts his hat that he wants to talk i have been quite touched by the change in the poor old man when he sat down beside me he said in a very gentle way i want to say something to you miss i could see he was not at ease so i took his poor old wrinkled hand in mine and asked him to speak fully so he said leaving his hand in mine i m afraid my deary that i must have shocked you by all the wicked things i ve been sayin about the dead and such like for weeks past but i didn t mean them and i want ye to remember that when i m gone we aud folks that be daffled and with one foot abaft the krok hooal don t altogether like to think of it and we don t want to feel scart of it an that s why i ve took to makin light of it so that i d cheer up my own heart a bit but lord love ye miss i ain t afraid of dyin not a bit only i don t want to die if i can help it my time must be nigh at hand now for i be aud and a hundred years is too much for any man to expect and i m so nigh it that the aud man is already whettin his scythe ye see i can t get out o the habit of caffin about it all at once the chafts will wag as they be used to some day soon the angel of death will sound his trumpet for me but don t ye dooal an greet my deary for he saw that i was crying if he should come this very night i d not refuse to answer his call for life be after all only a waitin for somethin else than what we re doin and death be all that we can rightly depend on but i m content for it s comin to me my deary and comin quick it may be comin while we be lookin and wonderin maybe it s in that wind out over the sea that s bringin with it loss and wreck and sore distress and sad hearts look look he cried suddenly there s something in that wind and in the hoast beyont that sounds and looks and tastes and smells like death it s in the air i feel it comin lord make me answer cheerful when my call comes he held up his arms devoutly and raised his hat his mouth moved as though he were praying after a few minutes silence he got up shook hands with me and blessed me and said good bye and hobbled off it all touched me and upset me very much i was glad when the coastguard came along with his spy glass under his arm he stopped to talk with me as he always does but all the time kept looking at a strange ship i can t make her out he said she s a russian by the look of her but she s knocking about in the queerest way she doesn t know her mind a bit she seems to see the storm coming but can t decide whether to run up north in the open or to put in here look there again she is steered mighty strangely for she doesn t mind the hand on the wheel changes about with every puff of wind we ll hear more of her before this time to morrow chapter vii cutting from the dailygraph august pasted in mina murray s journal from a correspondent whitby one of the greatest and suddenest storms on record has just been experienced here with results both strange and unique the weather had been somewhat sultry but not to any degree uncommon in the month of august saturday evening was as fine as was ever known and the great body of holiday makers laid out yesterday for visits to mulgrave woods robin hood s bay rig mill runswick staithes and the various trips in the neighbourhood of whitby the steamers emma and scarborough made trips up and down the coast and there was an unusual amount of tripping both to and from whitby the day was unusually fine till the afternoon when some of the gossips who frequent the east cliff churchyard and from that commanding eminence watch the wide sweep of sea visible to the north and east called attention to a sudden show of mares tails high in the sky to the north west the wind was then blowing from the south west in the mild degree which in barometrical language is ranked no light breeze the coastguard on duty at once made report and one old fisherman who for more than half a century has kept watch on weather signs from the east cliff foretold in an emphatic manner the coming of a sudden storm the approach of sunset was so very beautiful so grand in its masses of splendidly coloured clouds that there was quite an assemblage on the walk along the cliff in the old churchyard to enjoy the beauty before the sun dipped below the black mass of kettleness standing boldly athwart the western sky its downward way was marked by myriad clouds of every sunset colour flame purple pink green violet and all the tints of gold with here and there masses not large but of seemingly absolute blackness in all sorts of shapes as well outlined as colossal silhouettes the experience was not lost on the painters and doubtless some of the sketches of the prelude to the great storm will grace the r a and r i walls in may next more than one captain made up his mind then and there that his cobble or his mule as they term the different classes of boats would remain in the harbour till the storm had passed the wind fell away entirely during the evening and at midnight there was a dead calm a sultry heat and that prevailing intensity which on the approach of thunder affects persons of a sensitive nature there were but few lights in sight at sea for even the coasting steamers which usually hug the shore so closely kept well to seaward and but few fishing boats were in sight the only sail noticeable was a foreign schooner with all sails set which was seemingly going westwards the foolhardiness or ignorance of her officers was a prolific theme for comment whilst she remained in sight and efforts were made to signal her to reduce sail in face of her danger before the night shut down she was seen with sails idly flapping as she gently rolled on the undulating swell of the sea as idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean shortly before ten o clock the stillness of the air grew quite oppressive and the silence was so marked that the bleating of a sheep inland or the barking of a dog in the town was distinctly heard and the band on the pier with its lively french air was like a discord in the great harmony of nature s silence a little after midnight came a strange sound from over the sea and high overhead the air began to carry a strange faint hollow booming then without warning the tempest broke with a rapidity which at the time seemed incredible and even afterwards is impossible to realize the whole aspect of nature at once became convulsed the waves rose in growing fury each overtopping its fellow till in a very few minutes the lately glassy sea was like a roaring and devouring monster white crested waves beat madly on the level sands and rushed up the shelving cliffs others broke over the piers and with their spume swept the lanthorns of the lighthouses which rise from the end of either pier of whitby harbour the wind roared like thunder and blew with such force that it was with difficulty that even strong men kept their feet or clung with grim clasp to the iron stanchions it was found necessary to clear the entire piers from the mass of onlookers or else the fatalities of the night would have been increased manifold to add to the difficulties and dangers of the time masses of sea fog came drifting inland white wet clouds which swept by in ghostly fashion so dank and damp and cold that it needed but little effort of imagination to think that the spirits of those lost at sea were touching their living brethren with the clammy hands of death and many a one shuddered as the wreaths of sea mist swept by at times the mist cleared and the sea for some distance could be seen in the glare of the lightning which now came thick and fast followed by such sudden peals of thunder that the whole sky overhead seemed trembling under the shock of the footsteps of the storm some of the scenes thus revealed were of immeasurable grandeur and of absorbing interest the sea running mountains high threw skywards with each wave mighty masses of white foam which the tempest seemed to snatch at and whirl away into space here and there a fishing boat with a rag of sail running madly for shelter before the blast now and again the white wings of a storm tossed sea bird on the summit of the east cliff the new searchlight was ready for experiment but had not yet been tried the officers in charge of it got it into working order and in the pauses of the inrushing mist swept with it the surface of the sea once or twice its service was most effective as when a fishing boat with gunwale under water rushed into the harbour able by the guidance of the sheltering light to avoid the danger of dashing against the piers as each boat achieved the safety of the port there was a shout of joy from the mass of people on shore a shout which for a moment seemed to cleave the gale and was then swept away in its rush before long the searchlight discovered some distance away a schooner with all sails set apparently the same vessel which had been noticed earlier in the evening the wind had by this time backed to the east and there was a shudder amongst the watchers on the cliff as they realized the terrible danger in which she now was between her and the port lay the great flat reef on which so many good ships have from time to time suffered and with the wind blowing from its present quarter it would be quite impossible that she should fetch the entrance of the harbour it was now nearly the hour of high tide but the waves were so great that in their troughs the shallows of the shore were almost visible and the schooner with all sails set was rushing with such speed that in the words of one old salt she must fetch up somewhere if it was only in hell then came another rush of sea fog greater than any hitherto a mass of dank mist which seemed to close on all things like a grey pall and left available to men only the organ of hearing for the roar of the tempest and the crash of the thunder and the booming of the mighty billows came through the damp oblivion even louder than before the rays of the searchlight were kept fixed on the harbour mouth across the east pier where the shock was expected and men waited breathless the wind suddenly shifted to the north east and the remnant of the sea fog melted in the blast and then mirabile dictu between the piers leaping from wave to wave as it rushed at headlong speed swept the strange schooner before the blast with all sail set and gained the safety of the harbour the searchlight followed her and a shudder ran through all who saw her for lashed to the helm was a corpse with drooping head which swung horribly to and fro at each motion of the ship no other form could be seen on deck at all a great awe came on all as they realised that the ship as if by a miracle had found the harbour unsteered save by the hand of a dead man however all took place more quickly than it takes to write these words the schooner paused not but rushing across the harbour pitched herself on that accumulation of sand and gravel washed by many tides and many storms into the south east corner of the pier jutting under the east cliff known locally as tate hill pier there was of course a considerable concussion as the vessel drove up on the sand heap every spar rope and stay was strained and some of the top hammer came crashing down but strangest of all the very instant the shore was touched an immense dog sprang up on deck from below as if shot up by the concussion and running forward jumped from the bow on the sand making straight for the steep cliff where the churchyard hangs over the laneway to the east pier so steeply that some of the flat tombstones thruff steans or through stones as they call them in the whitby vernacular actually project over where the sustaining cliff has fallen away it disappeared in the darkness which seemed intensified just beyond the focus of the searchlight it so happened that there was no one at the moment on tate hill pier as all those whose houses are in close proximity were either in bed or were out on the heights above thus the coastguard on duty on the eastern side of the harbour who at once ran down to the little pier was the first to climb on board the men working the searchlight after scouring the entrance of the harbour without seeing anything then turned the light on the derelict and kept it there the coastguard ran aft and when he came beside the wheel bent over to examine it and recoiled at once as though under some sudden emotion this seemed to pique general curiosity and quite a number of people began to run it is a good way round from the west cliff by the drawbridge to tate hill pier but your correspondent is a fairly good runner and came well ahead of the crowd when i arrived however i found already assembled on the pier a crowd whom the coastguard and police refused to allow to come on board by the courtesy of the chief boatman i was as your correspondent permitted to climb on deck and was one of a small group who saw the dead seaman whilst actually lashed to the wheel it was no wonder that the coastguard was surprised or even awed for not often can such a sight have been seen the man was simply fastened by his hands tied one over the other to a spoke of the wheel between the inner hand and the wood was a crucifix the set of beads on which it was fastened being around both wrists and wheel and all kept fast by the binding cords the poor fellow may have been seated at one time but the flapping and buffeting of the sails had worked through the rudder of the wheel and dragged him to and fro so that the cords with which he was tied had cut the flesh to the bone accurate note was made of the state of things and a doctor surgeon j m caffyn of east elliot place who came immediately after me declared after making examination that the man must have been dead for quite two days in his pocket was a bottle carefully corked empty save for a little roll of paper which proved to be the addendum to the log the coastguard said the man must have tied up his own hands fastening the knots with his teeth the fact that a coastguard was the first on board may save some complications later on in the admiralty court for coastguards cannot claim the salvage which is the right of the first civilian entering on a derelict already however the legal tongues are wagging and one young law student is loudly asserting that the rights of the owner are already completely sacrificed his property being held in contravention of the statutes of mortmain since the tiller as emblemship if not proof of delegated possession is held in a dead hand it is needless to say that the dead steersman has been reverently removed from the place where he held his honourable watch and ward till death a steadfastness as noble as that of the young casabianca and placed in the mortuary to await inquest already the sudden storm is passing and its fierceness is abating crowds are scattering homeward and the sky is beginning to redden over the yorkshire wolds i shall send in time for your next issue further details of the derelict ship which found her way so miraculously into harbour in the storm whitby august the sequel to the strange arrival of the derelict in the storm last night is almost more startling than the thing itself it turns out that the schooner is a russian from varna and is called the demeter she is almost entirely in ballast of silver sand with only a small amount of cargo a number of great wooden boxes filled with mould this cargo was consigned to a whitby solicitor mr s f billington of the crescent who this morning went aboard and formally took possession of the goods consigned to him the russian consul too acting for the charter party took formal possession of the ship and paid all harbour dues etc nothing is talked about here to day except the strange coincidence the officials of the board of trade have been most exacting in seeing that every compliance has been made with existing regulations as the matter is to be a nine days wonder they are evidently determined that there shall be no cause of after complaint a good deal of interest was abroad concerning the dog which landed when the ship struck and more than a few of the members of the s p c a which is very strong in whitby have tried to befriend the animal to the general disappointment however it was not to be found it seems to have disappeared entirely from the town it may be that it was frightened and made its way on to the moors where it is still hiding in terror there are some who look with dread on such a possibility lest later on it should in itself become a danger for it is evidently a fierce brute early this morning a large dog a half bred mastiff belonging to a coal merchant close to tate hill pier was found dead in the roadway opposite to its master s yard it had been fighting and manifestly had had a savage opponent for its throat was torn away and its belly was slit open as if with a savage claw later by the kindness of the board of trade inspector i have been permitted to look over the log book of the demeter which was in order up to within three days but contained nothing of special interest except as to facts of missing men the greatest interest however is with regard to the paper found in the bottle which was to day produced at the inquest and a more strange narrative than the two between them unfold it has not been my lot to come across as there is no motive for concealment i am permitted to use them and accordingly send you a rescript simply omitting technical details of seamanship and supercargo it almost seems as though the captain had been seized with some kind of mania before he had got well into blue water and that this had developed persistently throughout the voyage of course my statement must be taken cum grano since i am writing from the dictation of a clerk of the russian consul who kindly translated for me time being short log of the demeter varna to whitby written july things so strange happening that i shall keep accurate note henceforth till we land on july we finished taking in cargo silver sand and boxes of earth at noon set sail east wind fresh crew five hands two mates cook and myself captain on july at dawn entered bosphorus boarded by turkish customs officers backsheesh all correct under way at p m on july through dardanelles more customs officers and flagboat of guarding squadron backsheesh again work of officers thorough but quick want us off soon at dark passed into archipelago on july passed cape matapan crew dissatisfied about something seemed scared but would not speak out on july was somewhat anxious about crew men all steady fellows who sailed with me before mate could not make out what was wrong they only told him there was something and crossed themselves mate lost temper with one of them that day and struck him expected fierce quarrel but all was quiet on july mate reported in the morning that one of crew petrofsky was missing could not account for it took larboard watch eight bells last night was relieved by abramoff but did not go to bunk men more downcast than ever all said they expected something of the kind but would not say more than there was something aboard mate getting very impatient with them feared some trouble ahead on july yesterday one of the men olgaren came to my cabin and in an awestruck way confided to me that he thought there was a strange man aboard the ship he said that in his watch he had been sheltering behind the deck house as there was a rain storm when he saw a tall thin man who was not like any of the crew come up the companion way and go along the deck forward and disappear he followed cautiously but when he got to bows found no one and the hatchways were all closed he was in a panic of superstitious fear and i am afraid the panic may spread to allay it i shall to day search entire ship carefully from stem to stern later in the day i got together the whole crew and told them as they evidently thought there was some one in the ship we would search from stem to stern first mate angry said it was folly and to yield to such foolish ideas would demoralise the men said he would engage to keep them out of trouble with a handspike i let him take the helm while the rest began thorough search all keeping abreast with lanterns we left no corner unsearched as there were only the big wooden boxes there were no odd corners where a man could hide men much relieved when search over and went back to work cheerfully first mate scowled but said nothing july rough weather last three days and all hands busy with sails no time to be frightened men seem to have forgotten their dread mate cheerful again and all on good terms praised men for work in bad weather passed gibralter and out through straits all well july there seems some doom over this ship already a hand short and entering on the bay of biscay with wild weather ahead and yet last night another man lost disappeared like the first he came off his watch and was not seen again men all in a panic of fear sent a round robin asking to have double watch as they fear to be alone mate angry fear there will be some trouble as either he or the men will do some violence july four days in hell knocking about in a sort of maelstrom and the wind a tempest no sleep for any one men all worn out hardly know how to set a watch since no one fit to go on second mate volunteered to steer and watch and let men snatch a few hours sleep wind abating seas still terrific but feel them less as ship is steadier july another tragedy had single watch to night as crew too tired to double when morning watch came on deck could find no one except steersman raised outcry and all came on deck thorough search but no one found are now without second mate and crew in a panic mate and i agreed to go armed henceforth and wait for any sign of cause july last night rejoiced we are nearing england weather fine all sails set retired worn out slept soundly awaked by mate telling me that both man of watch and steersman missing only self and mate and two hands left to work ship august two days of fog and not a sail sighted had hoped when in the english channel to be able to signal for help or get in somewhere not having power to work sails have to run before wind dare not lower as could not raise them again we seem to be drifting to some terrible doom mate now more demoralised than either of men his stronger nature seems to have worked inwardly against himself men are beyond fear working stolidly and patiently with minds made up to worst they are russian he roumanian august midnight woke up from few minutes sleep by hearing a cry seemingly outside my port could see nothing in fog rushed on deck and ran against mate tells me heard cry and ran but no sign of man on watch one more gone lord help us mate says we must be past straits of dover as in a moment of fog lifting he saw north foreland just as he heard the man cry out if so we are now off in the north sea and only god can guide us in the fog which seems to move with us and god seems to have deserted us august at midnight i went to relieve the man at the wheel and when i got to it found no one there the wind was steady and as we ran before it there was no yawing i dared not leave it so shouted for the mate after a few seconds he rushed up on deck in his flannels he looked wild eyed and haggard and i greatly fear his reason has given way he came close to me and whispered hoarsely with his mouth to my ear as though fearing the very air might hear it is here i know it now on the watch last night i saw it like a man tall and thin and ghastly pale it was in the bows and looking out i crept behind it and gave it my knife but the knife went through it empty as the air and as he spoke he took his knife and drove it savagely into space then he went on but it is here and i ll find it it is in the hold perhaps in one of those boxes i ll unscrew them one by one and see you work the helm and with a warning look and his finger on his lip he went below there was springing up a choppy wind and i could not leave the helm i saw him come out on deck again with a tool chest and a lantern and go down the forward hatchway he is mad stark raving mad and it s no use my trying to stop him he can t hurt those big boxes they are invoiced as clay and to pull them about is as harmless a thing as he can do so here i stay and mind the helm and write these notes i can only trust in god and wait till the fog clears then if i can t steer to any harbour with the wind that is i shall cut down sails and lie by and signal for help it is nearly all over now just as i was beginning to hope that the mate would come out calmer for i heard him knocking away at something in the hold and work is good for him there came up the hatchway a sudden startled scream which made my blood run cold and up on the deck he came as if shot from a gun a raging madman with his eyes rolling and his face convulsed with fear save me save me he cried and then looked round on the blanket of fog his horror turned to despair and in a steady voice he said you had better come too captain before it is too late he is there i know the secret now the sea will save me from him and it is all that is left before i could say a word or move forward to seize him he sprang on the bulwark and deliberately threw himself into the sea i suppose i know the secret too now it was this madman who had got rid of the men one by one and now he has followed them himself god help me how am i to account for all these horrors when i get to port when i get to port will that ever be august still fog which the sunrise cannot pierce i know there is sunrise because i am a sailor why else i know not i dared not go below i dared not leave the helm so here all night i stayed and in the dimness of the night i saw it him god forgive me but the mate was right to jump overboard it was better to die like a man to die like a sailor in blue water no man can object but i am captain and i must not leave my ship but i shall baffle this fiend or monster for i shall tie my hands to the wheel when my strength begins to fail and along with them i shall tie that which he it dare not touch and then come good wind or foul i shall save my soul and my honour as a captain i am growing weaker and the night is coming on if he can look me in the face again i may not have time to act if we are wrecked mayhap this bottle may be found and those who find it may understand if not well then all men shall know that i have been true to my trust god and the blessed virgin and the saints help a poor ignorant soul trying to do his duty of course the verdict was an open one there is no evidence to adduce and whether or not the man himself committed the murders there is now none to say the folk here hold almost universally that the captain is simply a hero and he is to be given a public funeral already it is arranged that his body is to be taken with a train of boats up the esk for a piece and then brought back to tate hill pier and up the abbey steps for he is to be buried in the churchyard on the cliff the owners of more than a hundred boats have already given in their names as wishing to follow him to the grave no trace has ever been found of the great dog at which there is much mourning for with public opinion in its present state he would i believe be adopted by the town to morrow will see the funeral and so will end this one more mystery of the sea mina murray s journal august lucy was very restless all night and i too could not sleep the storm was fearful and as it boomed loudly among the chimney pots it made me shudder when a sharp puff came it seemed to be like a distant gun strangely enough lucy did not wake but she got up twice and dressed herself fortunately each time i awoke in time and managed to undress her without waking her and got her back to bed it is a very strange thing this sleep walking for as soon as her will is thwarted in any physical way her intention if there be any disappears and she yields herself almost exactly to the routine of her life early in the morning we both got up and went down to the harbour to see if anything had happened in the night there were very few people about and though the sun was bright and the air clear and fresh the big grim looking waves that seemed dark themselves because the foam that topped them was like snow forced themselves in through the narrow mouth of the harbour like a bullying man going through a crowd somehow i felt glad that jonathan was not on the sea last night but on land but oh is he on land or sea where is he and how i am getting fearfully anxious about him if i only knew what to do and could do anything august the funeral of the poor sea captain to day was most touching every boat in the harbour seemed to be there and the coffin was carried by captains all the way from tate hill pier up to the churchyard lucy came with me and we went early to our old seat whilst the cort ge of boats went up the river to the viaduct and came down again we had a lovely view and saw the procession nearly all the way the poor fellow was laid to rest quite near our seat so that we stood on it when the time came and saw everything poor lucy seemed much upset she was restless and uneasy all the time and i cannot but think that her dreaming at night is telling on her she is quite odd in one thing she will not admit to me that there is any cause for restlessness or if there be she does not understand it herself there is an additional cause in that poor old mr swales was found dead this morning on our seat his neck being broken he had evidently as the doctor said fallen back in the seat in some sort of fright for there was a look of fear and horror on his face that the men said made them shudder poor dear old man perhaps he had seen death with his dying eyes lucy is so sweet and sensitive that she feels influences more acutely than other people do just now she was quite upset by a little thing which i did not much heed though i am myself very fond of animals one of the men who came up here often to look for the boats was followed by his dog the dog is always with him they are both quiet persons and i never saw the man angry nor heard the dog bark during the service the dog would not come to its master who was on the seat with us but kept a few yards off barking and howling its master spoke to it gently and then harshly and then angrily but it would neither come nor cease to make a noise it was in a sort of fury with its eyes savage and all its hairs bristling out like a cat s tail when puss is on the war path finally the man too got angry and jumped down and kicked the dog and then took it by the scruff of the neck and half dragged and half threw it on the tombstone on which the seat is fixed the moment it touched the stone the poor thing became quiet and fell all into a tremble it did not try to get away but crouched down quivering and cowering and was in such a pitiable state of terror that i tried though without effect to comfort it lucy was full of pity too but she did not attempt to touch the dog but looked at it in an agonised sort of way i greatly fear that she is of too super sensitive a nature to go through the world without trouble she will be dreaming of this to night i am sure the whole agglomeration of things the ship steered into port by a dead man his attitude tied to the wheel with a crucifix and beads the touching funeral the dog now furious and now in terror will all afford material for her dreams i think it will be best for her to go to bed tired out physically so i shall take her for a long walk by the cliffs to robin hood s bay and back she ought not to have much inclination for sleep walking then chapter viii mina murray s journal same day o clock p m oh but i am tired if it were not that i had made my diary a duty i should not open it to night we had a lovely walk lucy after a while was in gay spirits owing i think to some dear cows who came nosing towards us in a field close to the lighthouse and frightened the wits out of us i believe we forgot everything except of course personal fear and it seemed to wipe the slate clean and give us a fresh start we had a capital severe tea at robin hood s bay in a sweet little old fashioned inn with a bow window right over the seaweed covered rocks of the strand i believe we should have shocked the new woman with our appetites men are more tolerant bless them then we walked home with some or rather many stoppages to rest and with our hearts full of a constant dread of wild bulls lucy was really tired and we intended to creep off to bed as soon as we could the young curate came in however and mrs westenra asked him to stay for supper lucy and i had both a fight for it with the dusty miller i know it was a hard fight on my part and i am quite heroic i think that some day the bishops must get together and see about breeding up a new class of curates who don t take supper no matter how they may be pressed to and who will know when girls are tired lucy is asleep and breathing softly she has more colour in her cheeks than usual and looks oh so sweet if mr holmwood fell in love with her seeing her only in the drawing room i wonder what he would say if he saw her now some of the new women writers will some day start an idea that men and women should be allowed to see each other asleep before proposing or accepting but i suppose the new woman won t condescend in future to accept she will do the proposing herself and a nice job she will make of it too there s some consolation in that i am so happy to night because dear lucy seems better i really believe she has turned the corner and that we are over her troubles with dreaming i should be quite happy if i only knew if jonathan god bless and keep him august a m diary again no sleep now so i may as well write i am too agitated to sleep we have had such an adventure such an agonising experience i fell asleep as soon as i had closed my diary suddenly i became broad awake and sat up with a horrible sense of fear upon me and of some feeling of emptiness around me the room was dark so i could not see lucy s bed i stole across and felt for her the bed was empty i lit a match and found that she was not in the room the door was shut but not locked as i had left it i feared to wake her mother who has been more than usually ill lately so threw on some clothes and got ready to look for her as i was leaving the room it struck me that the clothes she wore might give me some clue to her dreaming intention dressing gown would mean house dress outside dressing gown and dress were both in their places thank god i said to myself she cannot be far as she is only in her nightdress i ran downstairs and looked in the sitting room not there then i looked in all the other open rooms of the house with an ever growing fear chilling my heart finally i came to the hall door and found it open it was not wide open but the catch of the lock had not caught the people of the house are careful to lock the door every night so i feared that lucy must have gone out as she was there was no time to think of what might happen a vague overmastering fear obscured all details i took a big heavy shawl and ran out the clock was striking one as i was in the crescent and there was not a soul in sight i ran along the north terrace but could see no sign of the white figure which i expected at the edge of the west cliff above the pier i looked across the harbour to the east cliff in the hope or fear i don t know which of seeing lucy in our favourite seat there was a bright full moon with heavy black driving clouds which threw the whole scene into a fleeting diorama of light and shade as they sailed across for a moment or two i could see nothing as the shadow of a cloud obscured st mary s church and all around it then as the cloud passed i could see the ruins of the abbey coming into view and as the edge of a narrow band of light as sharp as a sword cut moved along the church and the churchyard became gradually visible whatever my expectation was it was not disappointed for there on our favourite seat the silver light of the moon struck a half reclining figure snowy white the coming of the cloud was too quick for me to see much for shadow shut down on light almost immediately but it seemed to me as though something dark stood behind the seat where the white figure shone and bent over it what it was whether man or beast i could not tell i did not wait to catch another glance but flew down the steep steps to the pier and along by the fish market to the bridge which was the only way to reach the east cliff the town seemed as dead for not a soul did i see i rejoiced that it was so for i wanted no witness of poor lucy s condition the time and distance seemed endless and my knees trembled and my breath came laboured as i toiled up the endless steps to the abbey i must have gone fast and yet it seemed to me as if my feet were weighted with lead and as though every joint in my body were rusty when i got almost to the top i could see the seat and the white figure for i was now close enough to distinguish it even through the spells of shadow there was undoubtedly something long and black bending over the half reclining white figure i called in fright lucy lucy and something raised a head and from where i was i could see a white face and red gleaming eyes lucy did not answer and i ran on to the entrance of the churchyard as i entered the church was between me and the seat and for a minute or so i lost sight of her when i came in view again the cloud had passed and the moonlight struck so brilliantly that i could see lucy half reclining with her head lying over the back of the seat she was quite alone and there was not a sign of any living thing about when i bent over her i could see that she was still asleep her lips were parted and she was breathing not softly as usual with her but in long heavy gasps as though striving to get her lungs full at every breath as i came close she put up her hand in her sleep and pulled the collar of her nightdress close around her throat whilst she did so there came a little shudder through her as though she felt the cold i flung the warm shawl over her and drew the edges tight round her neck for i dreaded lest she should get some deadly chill from the night air unclad as she was i feared to wake her all at once so in order to have my hands free that i might help her i fastened the shawl at her throat with a big safety pin but i must have been clumsy in my anxiety and pinched or pricked her with it for by and by when her breathing became quieter she put her hand to her throat again and moaned when i had her carefully wrapped up i put my shoes on her feet and then began very gently to wake her at first she did not respond but gradually she became more and more uneasy in her sleep moaning and sighing occasionally at last as time was passing fast and for many other reasons i wished to get her home at once i shook her more forcibly till finally she opened her eyes and awoke she did not seem surprised to see me as of course she did not realise all at once where she was lucy always wakes prettily and even at such a time when her body must have been chilled with cold and her mind somewhat appalled at waking unclad in a churchyard at night she did not lose her grace she trembled a little and clung to me when i told her to come at once with me home she rose without a word with the obedience of a child as we passed along the gravel hurt my feet and lucy noticed me wince she stopped and wanted to insist upon my taking my shoes but i would not however when we got to the pathway outside the churchyard where there was a puddle of water remaining from the storm i daubed my feet with mud using each foot in turn on the other so that as we went home no one in case we should meet any one should notice my bare feet fortune favoured us and we got home without meeting a soul once we saw a man who seemed not quite sober passing along a street in front of us but we hid in a door till he had disappeared up an opening such as there are here steep little closes or wynds as they call them in scotland my heart beat so loud all the time that sometimes i thought i should faint i was filled with anxiety about lucy not only for her health lest she should suffer from the exposure but for her reputation in case the story should get wind when we got in and had washed our feet and had said a prayer of thankfulness together i tucked her into bed before falling asleep she asked even implored me not to say a word to any one even her mother about her sleep walking adventure i hesitated at first to promise but on thinking of the state of her mother s health and how the knowledge of such a thing would fret her and thinking too of how such a story might become distorted nay infallibly would in case it should leak out i thought it wiser to do so i hope i did right i have locked the door and the key is tied to my wrist so perhaps i shall not be again disturbed lucy is sleeping soundly the reflex of the dawn is high and far over the sea same day noon all goes well lucy slept till i woke her and seemed not to have even changed her side the adventure of the night does not seem to have harmed her on the contrary it has benefited her for she looks better this morning than she has done for weeks i was sorry to notice that my clumsiness with the safety pin hurt her indeed it might have been serious for the skin of her throat was pierced i must have pinched up a piece of loose skin and have transfixed it for there are two little red points like pin pricks and on the band of her nightdress was a drop of blood when i apologised and was concerned about it she laughed and petted me and said she did not even feel it fortunately it cannot leave a scar as it is so tiny same day night we passed a happy day the air was clear and the sun bright and there was a cool breeze we took our lunch to mulgrave woods mrs westenra driving by the road and lucy and i walking by the cliff path and joining her at the gate i felt a little sad myself for i could not but feel how absolutely happy it would have been had jonathan been with me but there i must only be patient in the evening we strolled in the casino terrace and heard some good music by spohr and mackenzie and went to bed early lucy seems more restful than she has been for some time and fell asleep at once i shall lock the door and secure the key the same as before though i do not expect any trouble to night august my expectations were wrong for twice during the night i was wakened by lucy trying to get out she seemed even in her sleep to be a little impatient at finding the door shut and went back to bed under a sort of protest i woke with the dawn and heard the birds chirping outside of the window lucy woke too and i was glad to see was even better than on the previous morning all her old gaiety of manner seemed to have come back and she came and snuggled in beside me and told me all about arthur i told her how anxious i was about jonathan and then she tried to comfort me well she succeeded somewhat for though sympathy can t alter facts it can help to make them more bearable august another quiet day and to bed with the key on my wrist as before again i awoke in the night and found lucy sitting up in bed still asleep pointing to the window i got up quietly and pulling aside the blind looked out it was brilliant moonlight and the soft effect of the light over the sea and sky merged together in one great silent mystery was beautiful beyond words between me and the moonlight flitted a great bat coming and going in great whirling circles once or twice it came quite close but was i suppose frightened at seeing me and flitted away across the harbour towards the abbey when i came back from the window lucy had lain down again and was sleeping peacefully she did not stir again all night august on the east cliff reading and writing all day lucy seems to have become as much in love with the spot as i am and it is hard to get her away from it when it is time to come home for lunch or tea or dinner this afternoon she made a funny remark we were coming home for dinner and had come to the top of the steps up from the west pier and stopped to look at the view as we generally do the setting sun low down in the sky was just dropping behind kettleness the red light was thrown over on the east cliff and the old abbey and seemed to bathe everything in a beautiful rosy glow we were silent for a while and suddenly lucy murmured as if to herself his red eyes again they are just the same it was such an odd expression coming apropos of nothing that it quite startled me i slewed round a little so as to see lucy well without seeming to stare at her and saw that she was in a half dreamy state with an odd look on her face that i could not quite make out so i said nothing but followed her eyes she appeared to be looking over at our own seat whereon was a dark figure seated alone i was a little startled myself for it seemed for an instant as if the stranger had great eyes like burning flames but a second look dispelled the illusion the red sunlight was shining on the windows of st mary s church behind our seat and as the sun dipped there was just sufficient change in the refraction and reflection to make it appear as if the light moved i called lucy s attention to the peculiar effect and she became herself with a start but she looked sad all the same it may have been that she was thinking of that terrible night up there we never refer to it so i said nothing and we went home to dinner lucy had a headache and went early to bed i saw her asleep and went out for a little stroll myself i walked along the cliffs to the westward and was full of sweet sadness for i was thinking of jonathan when coming home it was then bright moonlight so bright that though the front of our part of the crescent was in shadow everything could be well seen i threw a glance up at our window and saw lucy s head leaning out i thought that perhaps she was looking out for me so i opened my handkerchief and waved it she did not notice or make any movement whatever just then the moonlight crept round an angle of the building and the light fell on the window there distinctly was lucy with her head lying up against the side of the window sill and her eyes shut she was fast asleep and by her seated on the window sill was something that looked like a good sized bird i was afraid she might get a chill so i ran upstairs but as i came into the room she was moving back to her bed fast asleep and breathing heavily she was holding her hand to her throat as though to protect it from cold i did not wake her but tucked her up warmly i have taken care that the door is locked and the window securely fastened she looks so sweet as she sleeps but she is paler than is her wont and there is a drawn haggard look under her eyes which i do not like i fear she is fretting about something i wish i could find out what it is august rose later than usual lucy was languid and tired and slept on after we had been called we had a happy surprise at breakfast arthur s father is better and wants the marriage to come off soon lucy is full of quiet joy and her mother is glad and sorry at once later on in the day she told me the cause she is grieved to lose lucy as her very own but she is rejoiced that she is soon to have some one to protect her poor dear sweet lady she confided to me that she has got her death warrant she has not told lucy and made me promise secrecy her doctor told her that within a few months at most she must die for her heart is weakening at any time even now a sudden shock would be almost sure to kill her ah we were wise to keep from her the affair of the dreadful night of lucy s sleep walking august no diary for two whole days i have not had the heart to write some sort of shadowy pall seems to be coming over our happiness no news from jonathan and lucy seems to be growing weaker whilst her mother s hours are numbering to a close i do not understand lucy s fading away as she is doing she eats well and sleeps well and enjoys the fresh air but all the time the roses in her cheeks are fading and she gets weaker and more languid day by day at night i hear her gasping as if for air i keep the key of our door always fastened to my wrist at night but she gets up and walks about the room and sits at the open window last night i found her leaning out when i woke up and when i tried to wake her i could not she was in a faint when i managed to restore her she was as weak as water and cried silently between long painful struggles for breath when i asked her how she came to be at the window she shook her head and turned away i trust her feeling ill may not be from that unlucky prick of the safety pin i looked at her throat just now as she lay asleep and the tiny wounds seem not to have healed they are still open and if anything larger than before and the edges of them are faintly white they are like little white dots with red centres unless they heal within a day or two i shall insist on the doctor seeing about them letter samuel f billington son solicitors whitby to messrs carter paterson co london

as directed we are dear sirs yours respectfully pro carter paterson co mina murray s journal august i am happy to day and write sitting on the seat in the churchyard lucy is ever so much better last night she slept well all night and did not disturb me once the roses seem coming back already to her cheeks though she is still sadly pale and wan looking if she were in any way an mic i could understand it but she is not she is in gay spirits and full of life and cheerfulness all the morbid reticence seems to have passed from her and she has just reminded me as if i needed any reminding of that night and that it was here on this very seat i found her asleep as she told me she tapped playfully with the heel of her boot on the stone slab and said my poor little feet didn t make much noise then i daresay poor old mr swales would have told me that it was because i didn t want to wake up geordie as she was in such a communicative humour i asked her if she had dreamed at all that night before she answered that sweet puckered look came into her forehead which arthur i call him arthur from her habit says he loves and indeed i don t wonder that he does then she went on in a half dreaming kind of way as if trying to recall it to herself i didn t quite dream but it all seemed to be real i only wanted to be here in this spot i don t know why for i was afraid of something i don t know what i remember though i suppose i was asleep passing through the streets and over the bridge a fish leaped as i went by and i leaned over to look at it and i heard a lot of dogs howling the whole town seemed as if it must be full of dogs all howling at once as i went up the steps then i had a vague memory of something long and dark with red eyes just as we saw in the sunset and something very sweet and very bitter all around me at once and then i seemed sinking into deep green water and there was a singing in my ears as i have heard there is to drowning men and then everything seemed passing away from me my soul seemed to go out from my body and float about the air i seem to remember that once the west lighthouse was right under me and then there was a sort of agonising feeling as if i were in an earthquake and i came back and found you shaking my body i saw you do it before i felt you then she began to laugh it seemed a little uncanny to me and i listened to her breathlessly i did not quite like it and thought it better not to keep her mind on the subject so we drifted on to other subjects and lucy was like her old self again when we got home the fresh breeze had braced her up and her pale cheeks were really more rosy her mother rejoiced when she saw her and we all spent a very happy evening together august joy joy joy although not all joy at last news of jonathan the dear fellow has been ill that is why he did not write i am not afraid to think it or say it now that i know mr hawkins sent me on the letter and wrote himself oh so kindly i am to leave in the morning and go over to jonathan and to help to nurse him if necessary and to bring him home mr hawkins says it would not be a bad thing if we were to be married out there i have cried over the good sister s letter till i can feel it wet against my bosom where it lies it is of jonathan and must be next my heart for he is in my heart my journey is all mapped out and my luggage ready i am only taking one change of dress lucy will bring my trunk to london and keep it till i send for it for it may be that i must write no more i must keep it to say to jonathan my husband the letter that he has seen and touched must comfort me till we meet letter sister agatha hospital of st joseph and ste mary buda pesth to miss wilhelmina murray august dear madam i write by desire of mr jonathan harker who is himself not strong enough to write though progressing well thanks to god and st joseph and ste mary he has been under our care for nearly six weeks suffering from a violent brain fever he wishes me to convey his love and to say that by this post i write for him to mr peter hawkins exeter to say with his dutiful respects that he is sorry for his delay and that all of his work is completed he will require some few weeks rest in our sanatorium in the hills but will then return he wishes me to say that he has not sufficient money with him and that he would like to pay for his staying here so that others who need shall not be wanting for help believe me yours with sympathy and all blessings sister agatha p s my patient being asleep i open this to let you know something more he has told me all about you and that you are shortly to be his wife all blessings to you both he has had some fearful shock so says our doctor and in his delirium his ravings have been dreadful of wolves and poison and blood of ghosts and demons and i fear to say of what be careful with him always that there may be nothing to excite him of this kind for a long time to come the traces of such an illness as his do not lightly die away we should have written long ago but we knew nothing of his friends and there was on him nothing that any one could understand he came in the train from klausenburg and the guard was told by the station master there that he rushed into the station shouting for a ticket for home seeing from his violent demeanour that he was english they gave him a ticket for the furthest station on the way thither that the train reached be assured that he is well cared for he has won all hearts by his sweetness and gentleness he is truly getting on well and i have no doubt will in a few weeks be all himself but be careful of him for safety s sake there are i pray god and st joseph and ste mary many many happy years for you both dr seward s diary august strange and sudden change in renfield last night about eight o clock he began to get excited and sniff about as a dog does when setting the attendant was struck by his manner and knowing my interest in him encouraged him to talk he is usually respectful to the attendant and at times servile but to night the man tells me he was quite haughty would not condescend to talk with him at all all he would say was i don t want to talk to you you don t count now the master is at hand the attendant thinks it is some sudden form of religious mania which has seized him if so we must look out for squalls for a strong man with homicidal and religious mania at once might be dangerous the combination is a dreadful one at nine o clock i visited him myself his attitude to me was the same as that to the attendant in his sublime self feeling the difference between myself and attendant seemed to him as nothing it looks like religious mania and he will soon think that he himself is god these infinitesimal distinctions between man and man are too paltry for an omnipotent being how these madmen give themselves away the real god taketh heed lest a sparrow fall but the god created from human vanity sees no difference between an eagle and a sparrow oh if men only knew for half an hour or more renfield kept getting excited in greater and greater degree i did not pretend to be watching him but i kept strict observation all the same all at once that shifty look came into his eyes which we always see when a madman has seized an idea and with it the shifty movement of the head and back which asylum attendants come to know so well he became quite quiet and went and sat on the edge of his bed resignedly and looked into space with lack lustre eyes i thought i would find out if his apathy were real or only assumed and tried to lead him to talk of his pets a theme which had never failed to excite his attention at first he made no reply but at length said testily bother them all i don t care a pin about them what i said you don t mean to tell me you don t care about spiders spiders at present are his hobby and the note book is filling up with columns of small figures to this he answered enigmatically the bride maidens rejoice the eyes that wait the coming of the bride but when the bride draweth nigh then the maidens shine not to the eyes that are filled he would not explain himself but remained obstinately seated on his bed all the time i remained with him i am weary to night and low in spirits i cannot but think of lucy and how different things might have been if i don t sleep at once chloral the modern morpheus c hcl o h o i must be careful not to let it grow into a habit no i shall take none to night i have thought of lucy and i shall not dishonour her by mixing the two if need be to night shall be sleepless later glad i made the resolution gladder that i kept to it i had lain tossing about and had heard the clock strike only twice when the night watchman came to me sent up from the ward to say that renfield had escaped i threw on my clothes and ran down at once my patient is too dangerous a person to be roaming about those ideas of his might work out dangerously with strangers the attendant was waiting for me he said he had seen him not ten minutes before seemingly asleep in his bed when he had looked through the observation trap in the door his attention was called by the sound of the window being wrenched out he ran back and saw his feet disappear through the window and had at once sent up for me he was only in his night gear and cannot be far off the attendant thought it would be more useful to watch where he should go than to follow him as he might lose sight of him whilst getting out of the building by the door he is a bulky man and couldn t get through the window i am thin so with his aid i got out but feet foremost and as we were only a few feet above ground landed unhurt the attendant told me the patient had gone to the left and had taken a straight line so i ran as quickly as i could as i got through the belt of trees i saw a white figure scale the high wall which separates our grounds from those of the deserted house i ran back at once told the watchman to get three or four men immediately and follow me into the grounds of carfax in case our friend might be dangerous i got a ladder myself and crossing the wall dropped down on the other side i could see renfield s figure just disappearing behind the angle of the house so i ran after him on the far side of the house i found him pressed close against the old ironbound oak door of the chapel he was talking apparently to some one but i was afraid to go near enough to hear what he was saying lest i might frighten him and he should run off chasing an errant swarm of bees is nothing to following a naked lunatic when the fit of escaping is upon him after a few minutes however i could see that he did not take note of anything around him and so ventured to draw nearer to him the more so as my men had now crossed the wall and were closing him in i heard him say i am here to do your bidding master i am your slave and you will reward me for i shall be faithful i have worshipped you long and afar off now that you are near i await your commands and you will not pass me by will you dear master in your distribution of good things he is a selfish old beggar anyhow he thinks of the loaves and fishes even when he believes he is in a real presence his manias make a startling combination when we closed in on him he fought like a tiger he is immensely strong for he was more like a wild beast than a man i never saw a lunatic in such a paroxysm of rage before and i hope i shall not again it is a mercy that we have found out his strength and his danger in good time with strength and determination like his he might have done wild work before he was caged he is safe now at any rate jack sheppard himself couldn t get free from the strait waistcoat that keeps him restrained and he s chained to the wall in the padded room his cries are at times awful but the silences that follow are more deadly still for he means murder in every turn and movement just now he spoke coherent words for the first time i shall be patient master it is coming coming coming so i took the hint and came too i was too excited to sleep but this diary has quieted me and i feel i shall get some sleep to night chapter ix letter mina harker to lucy westenra buda pesth august my dearest lucy i know you will be anxious to hear all that has happened since we parted at the railway station at whitby well my dear i got to hull all right and caught the boat to hamburg and then the train on here i feel that i can hardly recall anything of the journey except that i knew i was coming to jonathan and that as i should have to do some nursing i had better get all the sleep i could i found my dear one oh so thin and pale and weak looking all the resolution has gone out of his dear eyes and that quiet dignity which i told you was in his face has vanished he is only a wreck of himself and he does not remember anything that has happened to him for a long time past at least he wants me to believe so and i shall never ask he has had some terrible shock and i fear it might tax his poor brain if he were to try to recall it sister agatha who is a good creature and a born nurse tells me that he raved of dreadful things whilst he was off his head i wanted her to tell me what they were but she would only cross herself and say she would never tell that the ravings of the sick were the secrets of god and that if a nurse through her vocation should hear them she should respect her trust she is a sweet good soul and the next day when she saw i was troubled she opened up the subject again and after saying that she could never mention what my poor dear raved about added i can tell you this much my dear that it was not about anything which he has done wrong himself and you as his wife to be have no cause to be concerned he has not forgotten you or what he owes to you his fear was of great and terrible things which no mortal can treat of i do believe the dear soul thought i might be jealous lest my poor dear should have fallen in love with any other girl the idea of my being jealous about jonathan and yet my dear let me whisper i felt a thrill of joy through me when i knew that no other woman was a cause of trouble i am now sitting by his bedside where i can see his face while he sleeps he is waking when he woke he asked me for his coat as he wanted to get something from the pocket i asked sister agatha and she brought all his things i saw that amongst them was his note book and was going to ask him to let me look at it for i knew then that i might find some clue to his trouble but i suppose he must have seen my wish in my eyes for he sent me over to the window saying he wanted to be quite alone for a moment then he called me back and when i came he had his hand over the note book and he said to me very solemnly wilhelmina i knew then that he was in deadly earnest for he has never called me by that name since he asked me to marry him you know dear my ideas of the trust between husband and wife there should be no secret no concealment i have had a great shock and when i try to think of what it is i feel my head spin round and i do not know if it was all real or the dreaming of a madman you know i have had brain fever and that is to be mad the secret is here and i do not want to know it i want to take up my life here with our marriage for my dear we had decided to be married as soon as the formalities are complete are you willing wilhelmina to share my ignorance here is the book take it and keep it read it if you will but never let me know unless indeed some solemn duty should come upon me to go back to the bitter hours asleep or awake sane or mad recorded here he fell back exhausted and i put the book under his pillow and kissed him i have asked sister agatha to beg the superior to let our wedding be this afternoon and am waiting her reply she has come and told me that the chaplain of the english mission church has been sent for we are to be married in an hour or as soon after as jonathan awakes lucy the time has come and gone i feel very solemn but very very happy jonathan woke a little after the hour and all was ready and he sat up in bed propped up with pillows he answered his i will firmly and strongly i could hardly speak my heart was so full that even those words seemed to choke me the dear sisters were so kind please god i shall never never forget them nor the grave and sweet responsibilities i have taken upon me i must tell you of my wedding present when the chaplain and the sisters had left me alone with my husband oh lucy it is the first time i have written the words my husband left me alone with my husband i took the book from under his pillow and wrapped it up in white paper and tied it with a little bit of pale blue ribbon which was round my neck and sealed it over the knot with sealing wax and for my seal i used my wedding ring then i kissed it and showed it to my husband and told him that i would keep it so and then it would be an outward and visible sign for us all our lives that we trusted each other that i would never open it unless it were for his own dear sake or for the sake of some stern duty then he took my hand in his and oh lucy it was the first time he took his wife s hand and said that it was the dearest thing in all the wide world and that he would go through all the past again to win it if need be the poor dear meant to have said a part of the past but he cannot think of time yet and i shall not wonder if at first he mixes up not only the month but the year well my dear what could i say i could only tell him that i was the happiest woman in all the wide world and that i had nothing to give him except myself my life and my trust and that with these went my love and duty for all the days of my life and my dear when he kissed me and drew me to him with his poor weak hands it was like a very solemn pledge between us lucy dear do you know why i tell you all this it is not only because it is all sweet to me but because you have been and are very dear to me it was my privilege to be your friend and guide when you came from the schoolroom to prepare for the world of life i want you to see now and with the eyes of a very happy wife whither duty has led me so that in your own married life you too may be all happy as i am my dear please almighty god your life may be all it promises a long day of sunshine with no harsh wind no forgetting duty no distrust i must not wish you no pain for that can never be but i do hope you will be always as happy as i am now good bye my dear i shall post this at once and perhaps write you very soon again i must stop for jonathan is waking i must attend to my husband your ever loving mina harker letter lucy westenra to mina harker whitby august my dearest mina oceans of love and millions of kisses and may you soon be in your own home with your husband i wish you could be coming home soon enough to stay with us here the strong air would soon restore jonathan it has quite restored me i have an appetite like a cormorant am full of life and sleep well you will be glad to know that i have quite given up walking in my sleep i think i have not stirred out of my bed for a week that is when i once got into it at night arthur says i am getting fat by the way i forgot to tell you that arthur is here we have such walks and drives and rides and rowing and tennis and fishing together and i love him more than ever he tells me that he loves me more but i doubt that for at first he told me that he couldn t love me more than he did then but this is nonsense there he is calling to me so no more just at present from your loving lucy p s mother sends her love she seems better poor dear p p s we are to be married on september dr seward s diary august the case of renfield grows even more interesting he has now so far quieted that there are spells of cessation from his passion for the first week after his attack he was perpetually violent then one night just as the moon rose he grew quiet and kept murmuring to himself now i can wait now i can wait the attendant came to tell me so i ran down at once to have a look at him he was still in the strait waistcoat and in the padded room but the suffused look had gone from his face and his eyes had something of their old pleading i might almost say cringing softness i was satisfied with his present condition and directed him to be relieved the attendants hesitated but finally carried out my wishes without protest it was a strange thing that the patient had humour enough to see their distrust for coming close to me he said in a whisper all the while looking furtively at them they think i could hurt you fancy me hurting you the fools it was soothing somehow to the feelings to find myself dissociated even in the mind of this poor madman from the others but all the same i do not follow his thought am i to take it that i have anything in common with him so that we are as it were to stand together or has he to gain from me some good so stupendous that my well being is needful to him i must find out later on to night he will not speak even the offer of a kitten or even a full grown cat will not tempt him he will only say i don t take any stock in cats i have more to think of now and i can wait i can wait after a while i left him the attendant tells me that he was quiet until just before dawn and that then he began to get uneasy and at length violent until at last he fell into a paroxysm which exhausted him so that he swooned into a sort of coma three nights has the same thing happened violent all day then quiet from moonrise to sunrise i wish i could get some clue to the cause it would almost seem as if there was some influence which came and went happy thought we shall to night play sane wits against mad ones he escaped before without our help to night he shall escape with it we shall give him a chance and have the men ready to follow in case they are required august the unexpected always happens how well disraeli knew life our bird when he found the cage open would not fly so all our subtle arrangements were for nought at any rate we have proved one thing that the spells of quietness last a reasonable time we shall in future be able to ease his bonds for a few hours each day i have given orders to the night attendant merely to shut him in the padded room when once he is quiet until an hour before sunrise the poor soul s body will enjoy the relief even if his mind cannot appreciate it hark the unexpected again i am called the patient has once more escaped later another night adventure renfield artfully waited until the attendant was entering the room to inspect then he dashed out past him and flew down the passage i sent word for the attendants to follow again he went into the grounds of the deserted house and we found him in the same place pressed against the old chapel door when he saw me he became furious and had not the attendants seized him in time he would have tried to kill me as we were holding him a strange thing happened he suddenly redoubled his efforts and then as suddenly grew calm i looked round instinctively but could see nothing then i caught the patient s eye and followed it but could trace nothing as it looked into the moonlit sky except a big bat which was flapping its silent and ghostly way to the west bats usually wheel and flit about but this one seemed to go straight on as if it knew where it was bound for or had some intention of its own the patient grew calmer every instant and presently said you needn t tie me i shall go quietly without trouble we came back to the house i feel there is something ominous in his calm and shall not forget this night lucy westenra s diary hillingham august i must imitate mina and keep writing things down then we can have long talks when we do meet i wonder when it will be i wish she were with me again for i feel so unhappy last night i seemed to be dreaming again just as i was at whitby perhaps it is the change of air or getting home again it is all dark and horrid to me for i can remember nothing but i am full of vague fear and i feel so weak and worn out when arthur came to lunch he looked quite grieved when he saw me and i hadn t the spirit to try to be cheerful i wonder if i could sleep in mother s room to night i shall make an excuse and try august another bad night mother did not seem to take to my proposal she seems not too well herself and doubtless she fears to worry me i tried to keep awake and succeeded for a while but when the clock struck twelve it waked me from a doze so i must have been falling asleep there was a sort of scratching or flapping at the window but i did not mind it and as i remember no more i suppose i must then have fallen asleep more bad dreams i wish i could remember them this morning i am horribly weak my face is ghastly pale and my throat pains me it must be something wrong with my lungs for i don t seem ever to get air enough i shall try to cheer up when arthur comes or else i know he will be miserable to see me so letter arthur holmwood to dr seward albemarle hotel august my dear jack i want you to do me a favour lucy is ill that is she has no special disease but she looks awful and is getting worse every day i have asked her if there is any cause i do not dare to ask her mother for to disturb the poor lady s mind about her daughter in her present state of health would be fatal mrs westenra has confided to me that her doom is spoken disease of the heart though poor lucy does not know it yet i am sure that there is something preying on my dear girl s mind i am almost distracted when i think of her to look at her gives me a pang i told her i should ask you to see her and though she demurred at first i know why old fellow she finally consented it will be a painful task for you i know old friend but it is for her sake and i must not hesitate to ask or you to act you are to come to lunch at hillingham to morrow two o clock so as not to arouse any suspicion in mrs westenra and after lunch lucy will take an opportunity of being alone with you i shall come in for tea and we can go away together i am filled with anxiety and want to consult with you alone as soon as i can after you have seen her do not fail arthur telegram arthur holmwood to seward september am summoned to see my father who is worse am writing write me fully by to night s post to ring wire me if necessary letter from dr seward to arthur holmwood september my dear old fellow with regard to miss westenra s health i hasten to let you know at once that in my opinion there is not any functional disturbance or any malady that i know of at the same time i am not by any means satisfied with her appearance she is woefully different from what she was when i saw her last of course you must bear in mind that i did not have full opportunity of examination such as i should wish our very friendship makes a little difficulty which not even medical science or custom can bridge over i had better tell you exactly what happened leaving you to draw in a measure your own conclusions i shall then say what i have done and propose doing i found miss westenra in seemingly gay spirits her mother was present and in a few seconds i made up my mind that she was trying all she knew to mislead her mother and prevent her from being anxious i have no doubt she guesses if she does not know what need of caution there is we lunched alone and as we all exerted ourselves to be cheerful we got as some kind of reward for our labours some real cheerfulness amongst us then mrs westenra went to lie down and lucy was left with me we went into her boudoir and till we got there her gaiety remained for the servants were coming and going as soon as the door was closed however the mask fell from her face and she sank down into a chair with a great sigh and hid her eyes with her hand when i saw that her high spirits had failed i at once took advantage of her reaction to make a diagnosis she said to me very sweetly i cannot tell you how i loathe talking about myself i reminded her that a doctor s confidence was sacred but that you were grievously anxious about her she caught on to my meaning at once and settled that matter in a word tell arthur everything you choose i do not care for myself but all for him so i am quite free i could easily see that she is somewhat bloodless but i could not see the usual an mic signs and by a chance i was actually able to test the quality of her blood for in opening a window which was stiff a cord gave way and she cut her hand slightly with broken glass it was a slight matter in itself but it gave me an evident chance and i secured a few drops of the blood and have analysed them the qualitative analysis gives a quite normal condition and shows i should infer in itself a vigorous state of health in other physical matters i was quite satisfied that there is no need for anxiety but as there must be a cause somewhere i have come to the conclusion that it must be something mental she complains of difficulty in breathing satisfactorily at times and of heavy lethargic sleep with dreams that frighten her but regarding which she can remember nothing she says that as a child she used to walk in her sleep and that when in whitby the habit came back and that once she walked out in the night and went to east cliff where miss murray found her but she assures me that of late the habit has not returned i am in doubt and so have done the best thing i know of i have written to my old friend and master professor van helsing of amsterdam who knows as much about obscure diseases as any one in the world i have asked him to come over and as you told me that all things were to be at your charge i have mentioned to him who you are and your relations to miss westenra this my dear fellow is in obedience to your wishes for i am only too proud and happy to do anything i can for her van helsing would i know do anything for me for a personal reason so no matter on what ground he comes we must accept his wishes he is a seemingly arbitrary man but this is because he knows what he is talking about better than any one else he is a philosopher and a metaphysician and one of the most advanced scientists of his day and he has i believe an absolutely open mind this with an iron nerve a temper of the ice brook an indomitable resolution self command and toleration exalted from virtues to blessings and the kindliest and truest heart that beats these form his equipment for the noble work that he is doing for mankind work both in theory and practice for his views are as wide as his all embracing sympathy i tell you these facts that you may know why i have such confidence in him i have asked him to come at once i shall see miss westenra to morrow again she is to meet me at the stores so that i may not alarm her mother by too early a repetition of my call yours always john seward letter abraham van helsing m d d ph d lit etc etc to dr seward september my good friend when i have received your letter i am already coming to you by good fortune i can leave just at once without wrong to any of those who have trusted me were fortune other then it were bad for those who have trusted for i come to my friend when he call me to aid those he holds dear tell your friend that when that time you suck from my wound so swiftly the poison of the gangrene from that knife that our other friend too nervous let slip you did more for him when he wants my aids and you call for them than all his great fortune could do but it is pleasure added to do for him your friend it is to you that i come have then rooms for me at the great eastern hotel so that i may be near to hand and please it so arrange that we may see the young lady not too late on to morrow for it is likely that i may have to return here that night but if need be i shall come again in three days and stay longer if it must till then good bye my friend john van helsing letter dr seward to hon arthur holmwood september my dear art van helsing has come and gone he came on with me to hillingham and found that by lucy s discretion her mother was lunching out so that we were alone with her van helsing made a very careful examination of the patient he is to report to me and i shall advise you for of course i was not present all the time he is i fear much concerned but says he must think when i told him of our friendship and how you trust to me in the matter he said you must tell him all you think tell him what i think if you can guess it if you will nay i am not jesting this is no jest but life and death perhaps more i asked what he meant by that for he was very serious this was when we had come back to town and he was having a cup of tea before starting on his return to amsterdam he would not give me any further clue you must not be angry with me art because his very reticence means that all his brains are working for her good he will speak plainly enough when the time comes be sure so i told him i would simply write an account of our visit just as if i were doing a descriptive special article for the daily telegraph he seemed not to notice but remarked that the smuts in london were not quite so bad as they used to be when he was a student here i am to get his report to morrow if he can possibly make it in any case i am to have a letter well as to the visit lucy was more cheerful than on the day i first saw her and certainly looked better she had lost something of the ghastly look that so upset you and her breathing was normal she was very sweet to the professor as she always is and tried to make him feel at ease though i could see that the poor girl was making a hard struggle for it i believe van helsing saw it too for i saw the quick look under his bushy brows that i knew of old then he began to chat of all things except ourselves and diseases and with such an infinite geniality that i could see poor lucy s pretense of animation merge into reality then without any seeming change he brought the conversation gently round to his visit and suavely said my dear young miss i have the so great pleasure because you are so much beloved that is much my dear ever were there that which i do not see they told me you were down in the spirit and that you were of a ghastly pale to them i say pouf and he snapped his fingers at me and went on but you and i shall show them how wrong they are how can he and he pointed at me with the same look and gesture as that with which once he pointed me out to his class on or rather after a particular occasion which he never fails to remind me of know anything of a young ladies he has his madmans to play with and to bring them back to happiness and to those that love them it is much to do and oh but there are rewards in that we can bestow such happiness but the young ladies he has no wife nor daughter and the young do not tell themselves to the young but to the old like me who have known so many sorrows and the causes of them so my dear we will send him away to smoke the cigarette in the garden whiles you and i have little talk all to ourselves i took the hint and strolled about and presently the professor came to the window and called me in he looked grave but said i have made careful examination but there is no functional cause with you i agree that there has been much blood lost it has been but is not but the conditions of her are in no way an mic i have asked her to send me her maid that i may ask just one or two question that so i may not chance to miss nothing i know well what she will say and yet there is cause there is always cause for everything i must go back home and think you must send to me the telegram every day and if there be cause i shall come again the disease for not to be all well is a disease interest me and the sweet young dear she interest me too she charm me and for her if not for you or disease i come as i tell you he would not say a word more even when we were alone and so now art you know all i know i shall keep stern watch i trust your poor father is rallying it must be a terrible thing to you my dear old fellow to be placed in such a position between two people who are both so dear to you i know your idea of duty to your father and you are right to stick to it but if need be i shall send you word to come at once to lucy so do not be over anxious unless you hear from me dr seward s diary september zo phagous patient still keeps up our interest in him he had only one outburst and that was yesterday at an unusual time just before the stroke of noon he began to grow restless the attendant knew the symptoms and at once summoned aid fortunately the men came at a run and were just in time for at the stroke of noon he became so violent that it took all their strength to hold him in about five minutes however he began to get more and more quiet and finally sank into a sort of melancholy in which state he has remained up to now the attendant tells me that his screams whilst in the paroxysm were really appalling i found my hands full when i got in attending to some of the other patients who were frightened by him indeed i can quite understand the effect for the sounds disturbed even me though i was some distance away it is now after the dinner hour of the asylum and as yet my patient sits in a corner brooding with a dull sullen woe begone look in his face which seems rather to indicate than to show something directly i cannot quite understand it later another change in my patient at five o clock i looked in on him and found him seemingly as happy and contented as he used to be he was catching flies and eating them and was keeping note of his capture by making nail marks on the edge of the door between the ridges of padding when he saw me he came over and apologised for his bad conduct and asked me in a very humble cringing way to be led back to his own room and to have his note book again i thought it well to humour him so he is back in his room with the window open he has the sugar of his tea spread out on the window sill and is reaping quite a harvest of flies he is not now eating them but putting them into a box as of old and is already examining the corners of his room to find a spider i tried to get him to talk about the past few days for any clue to his thoughts would be of immense help to me but he would not rise for a moment or two he looked very sad and said in a sort of far away voice as though saying it rather to himself than to me all over all over he has deserted me no hope for me now unless i do it for myself then suddenly turning to me in a resolute way he said doctor won t you be very good to me and let me have a little more sugar i think it would be good for me and the flies i said yes the flies like it too and i like the flies therefore i like it and there are people who know so little as to think that madmen do not argue i procured him a double supply and left him as happy a man as i suppose any in the world i wish i could fathom his mind midnight another change in him i had been to see miss westenra whom i found much better and had just returned and was standing at our own gate looking at the sunset when once more i heard him yelling as his room is on this side of the house i could hear it better than in the morning it was a shock to me to turn from the wonderful smoky beauty of a sunset over london with its lurid lights and inky shadows and all the marvellous tints that come on foul clouds even as on foul water and to realise all the grim sternness of my own cold stone building with its wealth of breathing misery and my own desolate heart to endure it all i reached him just as the sun was going down and from his window saw the red disc sink as it sank he became less and less frenzied and just as it dipped he slid from the hands that held him an inert mass on the floor it is wonderful however what intellectual recuperative power lunatics have for within a few minutes he stood up quite calmly and looked around him i signalled to the attendants not to hold him for i was anxious to see what he would do he went straight over to the window and brushed out the crumbs of sugar then he took his fly box and emptied it outside and threw away the box then he shut the window and crossing over sat down on his bed all this surprised me so i asked him are you not going to keep flies any more no said he i am sick of all that rubbish he certainly is a wonderfully interesting study i wish i could get some glimpse of his mind or of the cause of his sudden passion stop there may be a clue after all if we can find why to day his paroxysms came on at high noon and at sunset can it be that there is a malign influence of the sun at periods which affects certain natures as at times the moon does others we shall see telegram seward london to van helsing amsterdam september patient still better to day telegram seward london to van helsing amsterdam september patient greatly improved good appetite sleeps naturally good spirits colour coming back telegram seward london to van helsing amsterdam september terrible change for the worse come at once do not lose an hour i hold over telegram to holmwood till have seen you chapter x letter dr seward to hon arthur holmwood september my dear art my news to day is not so good lucy this morning had gone back a bit there is however one good thing which has arisen from it mrs westenra was naturally anxious concerning lucy and has consulted me professionally about her i took advantage of the opportunity and told her that my old master van helsing the great specialist was coming to stay with me and that i would put her in his charge conjointly with myself so now we can come and go without alarming her unduly for a shock to her would mean sudden death and this in lucy s weak condition might be disastrous to her we are hedged in with difficulties all of us my poor old fellow but please god we shall come through them all right if any need i shall write so that if you do not hear from me take it for granted that i am simply waiting for news in haste yours ever john seward dr seward s diary september the first thing van helsing said to me when we met at liverpool street was have you said anything to our young friend the lover of her no i said i waited till i had seen you as i said in my telegram i wrote him a letter simply telling him that you were coming as miss westenra was not so well and that i should let him know if need be right my friend he said quite right better he not know as yet perhaps he shall never know i pray so but if it be needed then he shall know all and my good friend john let me caution you you deal with the madmen all men are mad in some way or the other and inasmuch as you deal discreetly with your madmen so deal with god s madmen too the rest of the world you tell not your madmen what you do nor why you do it you tell them not what you think so you shall keep knowledge in its place where it may rest where it may gather its kind around it and breed you and i shall keep as yet what we know here and here he touched me on the heart and on the forehead and then touched himself the same way i have for myself thoughts at the present later i shall unfold to you why not now i asked it may do some good we may arrive at some decision he stopped and looked at me and said my friend john when the corn is grown even before it has ripened while the milk of its mother earth is in him and the sunshine has not yet begun to paint him with his gold the husbandman he pull the ear and rub him between his rough hands and blow away the green chaff and say to you look he s good corn he will make good crop when the time comes i did not see the application and told him so for reply he reached over and took my ear in his hand and pulled it playfully as he used long ago to do at lectures and said the good husbandman tell you so then because he knows but not till then but you do not find the good husbandman dig up his planted corn to see if he grow that is for the children who play at husbandry and not for those who take it as of the work of their life see you now friend john i have sown my corn and nature has her work to do in making it sprout if he sprout at all there s some promise and i wait till the ear begins to swell he broke off for he evidently saw that i understood then he went on and very gravely you were always a careful student and your case book was ever more full than the rest you were only student then now you are master and i trust that good habit have not fail remember my friend that knowledge is stronger than memory and we should not trust the weaker even if you have not kept the good practise let me tell you that this case of our dear miss is one that may be mind i say may be of such interest to us and others that all the rest may not make him kick the beam as your peoples say take then good note of it nothing is too small i counsel you put down in record even your doubts and surmises hereafter it may be of interest to you to see how true you guess we learn from failure not from success when i described lucy s symptoms the same as before but infinitely more marked he looked very grave but said nothing he took with him a bag in which were many instruments and drugs the ghastly paraphernalia of our beneficial trade as he once called in one of his lectures the equipment of a professor of the healing craft when we were shown in mrs westenra met us she was alarmed but not nearly so much as i expected to find her nature in one of her beneficent moods has ordained that even death has some antidote to its own terrors here in a case where any shock may prove fatal matters are so ordered that from some cause or other the things not personal even the terrible change in her daughter to whom she is so attached do not seem to reach her it is something like the way dame nature gathers round a foreign body an envelope of some insensitive tissue which can protect from evil that which it would otherwise harm by contact if this be an ordered selfishness then we should pause before we condemn any one for the vice of egoism for there may be deeper root for its causes than we have knowledge of i used my knowledge of this phase of spiritual pathology and laid down a rule that she should not be present with lucy or think of her illness more than was absolutely required she assented readily so readily that i saw again the hand of nature fighting for life van helsing and i were shown up to lucy s room if i was shocked when i saw her yesterday i was horrified when i saw her to day she was ghastly chalkily pale the red seemed to have gone even from her lips and gums and the bones of her face stood out prominently her breathing was painful to see or hear van helsing s face grew set as marble and his eyebrows converged till they almost touched over his nose lucy lay motionless and did not seem to have strength to speak so for a while we were all silent then van helsing beckoned to me and we went gently out of the room the instant we had closed the door he stepped quickly along the passage to the next door which was open then he pulled me quickly in with him and closed the door my god he said this is dreadful there is no time to be lost she will die for sheer want of blood to keep the heart s action as it should be there must be transfusion of blood at once is it you or me i am younger and stronger professor it must be me then get ready at once i will bring up my bag i am prepared i went downstairs with him and as we were going there was a knock at the hall door when we reached the hall the maid had just opened the door and arthur was stepping quickly in he rushed up to me saying in an eager whisper jack i was so anxious i read between the lines of your letter and have been in an agony the dad was better so i ran down here to see for myself is not that gentleman dr van helsing i am so thankful to you sir for coming when first the professor s eye had lit upon him he had been angry at his interruption at such a time but now as he took in his stalwart proportions and recognised the strong young manhood which seemed to emanate from him his eyes gleamed without a pause he said to him gravely as he held out his hand sir you have come in time you are the lover of our dear miss she is bad very very bad nay my child do not go like that for he suddenly grew pale and sat down in a chair almost fainting you are to help her you can do more than any that live and your courage is your best help what can i do asked arthur hoarsely tell me and i shall do it my life is hers and i would give the last drop of blood in my body for her the professor has a strongly humorous side and i could from old knowledge detect a trace of its origin in his answer my young sir i do not ask so much as that not the last what shall i do there was fire in his eyes and his open nostril quivered with intent van helsing slapped him on the shoulder come he said you are a man and it is a man we want you are better than me better than my friend john arthur looked bewildered and the professor went on by explaining in a kindly way young miss is bad very bad she wants blood and blood she must have or die my friend john and i have consulted and we are about to perform what we call transfusion of blood to transfer from full veins of one to the empty veins which pine for him john was to give his blood as he is the more young and strong than me here arthur took my hand and wrung it hard in silence but now you are here you are more good than us old or young who toil much in the world of thought our nerves are not so calm and our blood not so bright than yours arthur turned to him and said if you only knew how gladly i would die for her you would understand he stopped with a sort of choke in his voice good boy said van helsing in the not so far off you will be happy that you have done all for her you love come now and be silent you shall kiss her once before it is done but then you must go and you must leave at my sign say no word to madame you know how it is with her there must be no shock any knowledge of this would be one come we all went up to lucy s room arthur by direction remained outside lucy turned her head and looked at us but said nothing she was not asleep but she was simply too weak to make the effort her eyes spoke to us that was all van helsing took some things from his bag and laid them on a little table out of sight then he mixed a narcotic and coming over to the bed said cheerily now little miss here is your medicine drink it off like a good child see i lift you so that to swallow is easy yes she had made the effort with success it astonished me how long the drug took to act this in fact marked the extent of her weakness the time seemed endless until sleep began to flicker in her eyelids at last however the narcotic began to manifest its potency and she fell into a deep sleep when the professor was satisfied he called arthur into the room and bade him strip off his coat then he added you may take that one little kiss whiles i bring over the table friend john help to me so neither of us looked whilst he bent over her van helsing turning to me said he is so young and strong and of blood so pure that we need not defibrinate it then with swiftness but with absolute method van helsing performed the operation as the transfusion went on something like life seemed to come back to poor lucy s cheeks and through arthur s growing pallor the joy of his face seemed absolutely to shine after a bit i began to grow anxious for the loss of blood was telling on arthur strong man as he was it gave me an idea of what a terrible strain lucy s system must have undergone that what weakened arthur only partially restored her but the professor s face was set and he stood watch in hand and with his eyes fixed now on the patient and now on arthur i could hear my own heart beat presently he said in a soft voice do not stir an instant it is enough you attend him i will look to her when all was over i could see how much arthur was weakened i dressed the wound and took his arm to bring him away when van helsing spoke without turning round the man seems to have eyes in the back of his head the brave lover i think deserve another kiss which he shall have presently and as he had now finished his operation he adjusted the pillow to the patient s head as he did so the narrow black velvet band which she seems always to wear round her throat buckled with an old diamond buckle which her lover had given her was dragged a little up and showed a red mark on her throat arthur did not notice it but i could hear the deep hiss of indrawn breath which is one of van helsing s ways of betraying emotion he said nothing at the moment but turned to me saying now take down our brave young lover give him of the port wine and let him lie down a while he must then go home and rest sleep much and eat much that he may be recruited of what he has so given to his love he must not stay here hold a moment i may take it sir that you are anxious of result then bring it with you that in all ways the operation is successful you have saved her life this time and you can go home and rest easy in mind that all that can be is i shall tell her all when she is well she shall love you none the less for what you have done good bye when arthur had gone i went back to the room lucy was sleeping gently but her breathing was stronger i could see the counterpane move as her breast heaved by the bedside sat van helsing looking at her intently the velvet band again covered the red mark i asked the professor in a whisper what do you make of that mark on her throat what do you make of it i have not examined it yet i answered and then and there proceeded to loose the band just over the external jugular vein there were two punctures not large but not wholesome looking there was no sign of disease but the edges were white and worn looking as if by some trituration it at once occurred to me that this wound or whatever it was might be the means of that manifest loss of blood but i abandoned the idea as soon as formed for such a thing could not be the whole bed would have been drenched to a scarlet with the blood which the girl must have lost to leave such a pallor as she had before the transfusion well said van helsing well said i i can make nothing of it the professor stood up i must go back to amsterdam to night he said there are books and things there which i want you must remain here all the night and you must not let your sight pass from her shall i have a nurse i asked we are the best nurses you and i you keep watch all night see that she is well fed and that nothing disturbs her you must not sleep all the night later on we can sleep you and i i shall be back as soon as possible and then we may begin may begin i said what on earth do you mean we shall see he answered as he hurried out he came back a moment later and put his head inside the door and said with warning finger held up remember she is your charge if you leave her and harm befall you shall not sleep easy hereafter dr seward s diary continued september i sat up all night with lucy the opiate worked itself off towards dusk and she waked naturally she looked a different being from what she had been before the operation her spirits even were good and she was full of a happy vivacity but i could see evidences of the absolute prostration which she had undergone when i told mrs westenra that dr van helsing had directed that i should sit up with her she almost pooh poohed the idea pointing out her daughter s renewed strength and excellent spirits i was firm however and made preparations for my long vigil when her maid had prepared her for the night i came in having in the meantime had supper and took a seat by the bedside she did not in any way make objection but looked at me gratefully whenever i caught her eye after a long spell she seemed sinking off to sleep but with an effort seemed to pull herself together and shook it off this was repeated several times with greater effort and with shorter pauses as the time moved on it was apparent that she did not want to sleep so i tackled the subject at once you do not want to go to sleep no i am afraid afraid to go to sleep why so it is the boon we all crave for ah not if you were like me if sleep was to you a presage of horror a presage of horror what on earth do you mean i don t know oh i don t know and that is what is so terrible all this weakness comes to me in sleep until i dread the very thought but my dear girl you may sleep to night i am here watching you and i can promise that nothing will happen ah i can trust you i seized the opportunity and said i promise you that if i see any evidence of bad dreams i will wake you at once you will oh will you really how good you are to me then i will sleep and almost at the word she gave a deep sigh of relief and sank back asleep all night long i watched by her she never stirred but slept on and on in a deep tranquil life giving health giving sleep her lips were slightly parted and her breast rose and fell with the regularity of a pendulum there was a smile on her face and it was evident that no bad dreams had come to disturb her peace of mind in the early morning her maid came and i left her in her care and took myself back home for i was anxious about many things i sent a short wire to van helsing and to arthur telling them of the excellent result of the operation my own work with its manifold arrears took me all day to clear off it was dark when i was able to inquire about my zo phagous patient the report was good he had been quite quiet for the past day and night a telegram came from van helsing at amsterdam whilst i was at dinner suggesting that i should be at hillingham to night as it might be well to be at hand and stating that he was leaving by the night mail and would join me early in the morning september i was pretty tired and worn out when i got to hillingham for two nights i had hardly had a wink of sleep and my brain was beginning to feel that numbness which marks cerebral exhaustion lucy was up and in cheerful spirits when she shook hands with me she looked sharply in my face and said no sitting up to night for you you are worn out i am quite well again indeed i am and if there is to be any sitting up it is i who will sit up with you i would not argue the point but went and had my supper lucy came with me and enlivened by her charming presence i made an excellent meal and had a couple of glasses of the more than excellent port then lucy took me upstairs and showed me a room next her own where a cozy fire was burning now she said you must stay here i shall leave this door open and my door too you can lie on the sofa for i know that nothing would induce any of you doctors to go to bed whilst there is a patient above the horizon if i want anything i shall call out and you can come to me at once i could not but acquiesce for i was dog tired and could not have sat up had i tried so on her renewing her promise to call me if she should want anything i lay on the sofa and forgot all about everything lucy westenra s diary september i feel so happy to night i have been so miserably weak that to be able to think and move about is like feeling sunshine after a long spell of east wind out of a steel sky somehow arthur feels very very close to me i seem to feel his presence warm about me i suppose it is that sickness and weakness are selfish things and turn our inner eyes and sympathy on ourselves whilst health and strength give love rein and in thought and feeling he can wander where he wills i know where my thoughts are if arthur only knew my dear my dear your ears must tingle as you sleep as mine do waking oh the blissful rest of last night how i slept with that dear good dr seward watching me and to night i shall not fear to sleep since he is close at hand and within call thank everybody for being so good to me thank god good night arthur dr seward s diary september i was conscious of the professor s hand on my head and started awake all in a second that is one of the things that we learn in an asylum at any rate and how is our patient well when i left her or rather when she left me i answered come let us see he said and together we went into the room the blind was down and i went over to raise it gently whilst van helsing stepped with his soft cat like tread over to the bed as i raised the blind and the morning sunlight flooded the room i heard the professor s low hiss of inspiration and knowing its rarity a deadly fear shot through my heart as i passed over he moved back and his exclamation of horror gott in himmel needed no enforcement from his agonised face he raised his hand and pointed to the bed and his iron face was drawn and ashen white i felt my knees begin to tremble there on the bed seemingly in a swoon lay poor lucy more horribly white and wan looking than ever even the lips were white and the gums seemed to have shrunken back from the teeth as we sometimes see in a corpse after a prolonged illness van helsing raised his foot to stamp in anger but the instinct of his life and all the long years of habit stood to him and he put it down again softly quick he said bring the brandy i flew to the dining room and returned with the decanter he wetted the poor white lips with it and together we rubbed palm and wrist and heart he felt her heart and after a few moments of agonising suspense said it is not too late it beats though but feebly all our work is undone we must begin again there is no young arthur here now i have to call on you yourself this time friend john as he spoke he was dipping into his bag and producing the instruments for transfusion i had taken off my coat and rolled up my shirt sleeve there was no possibility of an opiate just at present and no need of one and so without a moment s delay we began the operation after a time it did not seem a short time either for the draining away of one s blood no matter how willingly it be given is a terrible feeling van helsing held up a warning finger do not stir he said but i fear that with growing strength she may wake and that would make danger oh so much danger but i shall precaution take i shall give hypodermic injection of morphia he proceeded then swiftly and deftly to carry out his intent the effect on lucy was not bad for the faint seemed to merge subtly into the narcotic sleep it was with a feeling of personal pride that i could see a faint tinge of colour steal back into the pallid cheeks and lips no man knows till he experiences it what it is to feel his own life blood drawn away into the veins of the woman he loves the professor watched me critically that will do he said already i remonstrated you took a great deal more from art to which he smiled a sad sort of smile as he replied he is her lover her fianc you have work much work to do for her and for others and the present will suffice when we stopped the operation he attended to lucy whilst i applied digital pressure to my own incision i laid down whilst i waited his leisure to attend to me for i felt faint and a little sick by and by he bound up my wound and sent me downstairs to get a glass of wine for myself as i was leaving the room he came after me and half whispered mind nothing must be said of this if our young lover should turn up unexpected as before no word to him it would at once frighten him and enjealous him too there must be none so when i came back he looked at me carefully and then said you are not much the worse go into the room and lie on your sofa and rest awhile then have much breakfast and come here to me i followed out his orders for i knew how right and wise they were i had done my part and now my next duty was to keep up my strength i felt very weak and in the weakness lost something of the amazement at what had occurred i fell asleep on the sofa however wondering over and over again how lucy had made such a retrograde movement and how she could have been drained of so much blood with no sign anywhere to show for it i think i must have continued my wonder in my dreams for sleeping and waking my thoughts always came back to the little punctures in her throat and the ragged exhausted appearance of their edges tiny though they were lucy slept well into the day and when she woke she was fairly well and strong though not nearly so much so as the day before when van helsing had seen her he went out for a walk leaving me in charge with strict injunctions that i was not to leave her for a moment i could hear his voice in the hall asking the way to the nearest telegraph office lucy chatted with me freely and seemed quite unconscious that anything had happened i tried to keep her amused and interested when her mother came up to see her she did not seem to notice any change whatever but said to me gratefully we owe you so much dr seward for all you have done but you really must now take care not to overwork yourself you are looking pale yourself you want a wife to nurse and look after you a bit that you do as she spoke lucy turned crimson though it was only momentarily for her poor wasted veins could not stand for long such an unwonted drain to the head the reaction came in excessive pallor as she turned imploring eyes on me i smiled and nodded and laid my finger on my lips with a sigh she sank back amid her pillows van helsing returned in a couple of hours and presently said to me now you go home and eat much and drink enough make yourself strong i stay here to night and i shall sit up with little miss myself you and i must watch the case and we must have none other to know i have grave reasons no do not ask them think what you will do not fear to think even the most not probable good night in the hall two of the maids came to me and asked if they or either of them might not sit up with miss lucy they implored me to let them and when i said it was dr van helsing s wish that either he or i should sit up they asked me quite piteously to intercede with the foreign gentleman i was much touched by their kindness perhaps it is because i am weak at present and perhaps because it was on lucy s account that their devotion was manifested for over and over again have i seen similar instances of woman s kindness i got back here in time for a late dinner went my rounds all well and set this down whilst waiting for sleep it is coming september this afternoon i went over to hillingham found van helsing in excellent spirits and lucy much better shortly after i had arrived a big parcel from abroad came for the professor he opened it with much impressment assumed of course and showed a great bundle of white flowers these are for you miss lucy he said for me oh dr van helsing yes my dear but not for you to play with these are medicines here lucy made a wry face nay but they are not to take in a decoction or in nauseous form so you need not snub that so charming nose or i shall point out to my friend arthur what woes he may have to endure in seeing so much beauty that he so loves so much distort aha my pretty miss that bring the so nice nose all straight again this is medicinal but you do not know how i put him in your window i make pretty wreath and hang him round your neck so that you sleep well oh yes they like the lotus flower make your trouble forgotten it smell so like the waters of lethe and of that fountain of youth that the conquistadores sought for in the floridas and find him all too late whilst he was speaking lucy had been examining the flowers and smelling them now she threw them down saying with half laughter and half disgust oh professor i believe you are only putting up a joke on me why these flowers are only common garlic to my surprise van helsing rose up and said with all his sternness his iron jaw set and his bushy eyebrows meeting no trifling with me i never jest there is grim purpose in all i do and i warn you that you do not thwart me take care for the sake of others if not for your own then seeing poor lucy scared as she might well be he went on more gently oh little miss my dear do not fear me i only do for your good but there is much virtue to you in those so common flowers see i place them myself in your room i make myself the wreath that you are to wear but hush no telling to others that make so inquisitive questions we must obey and silence is a part of obedience and obedience is to bring you strong and well into loving arms that wait for you now sit still awhile come with me friend john and you shall help me deck the room with my garlic which is all the way from haarlem where my friend vanderpool raise herb in his glass houses all the year i had to telegraph yesterday or they would not have been here we went into the room taking the flowers with us the professor s actions were certainly odd and not to be found in any pharmacopoeia that i ever heard of first he fastened up the windows and latched them securely next taking a handful of the flowers he rubbed them all over the sashes as though to ensure that every whiff of air that might get in would be laden with the garlic smell then with the wisp he rubbed all over the jamb of the door above below and at each side and round the fireplace in the same way it all seemed grotesque to me and presently i said well professor i know you always have a reason for what you do but this certainly puzzles me it is well we have no sceptic here or he would say that you were working some spell to keep out an evil spirit perhaps i am he answered quietly as he began to make the wreath which lucy was to wear round her neck we then waited whilst lucy made her toilet for the night and when she was in bed he came and himself fixed the wreath of garlic round her neck the last words he said to her were take care you do not disturb it and even if the room feel close do not to night open the window or the door i promise said lucy and thank you both a thousand times for all your kindness to me oh what have i done to be blessed with such friends as we left the house in my fly which was waiting van helsing said to night i can sleep in peace and sleep i want two nights of travel much reading in the day between and much anxiety on the day to follow and a night to sit up without to wink to morrow in the morning early you call for me and we come together to see our pretty miss so much more strong for my spell which i have work ho ho he seemed so confident that i remembering my own confidence two nights before and with the baneful result felt awe and vague terror it must have been my weakness that made me hesitate to tell it to my friend but i felt it all the more like unshed tears chapter xi lucy westenra s diary september how good they all are to me i quite love that dear dr van helsing i wonder why he was so anxious about these flowers he positively frightened me he was so fierce and yet he must have been right for i feel comfort from them already somehow i do not dread being alone to night and i can go to sleep without fear i shall not mind any flapping outside the window oh the terrible struggle that i have had against sleep so often of late the pain of the sleeplessness or the pain of the fear of sleep with such unknown horrors as it has for me how blessed are some people whose lives have no fears no dreads to whom sleep is a blessing that comes nightly and brings nothing but sweet dreams well here i am to night hoping for sleep and lying like ophelia in the play with virgin crants and maiden strewments i never liked garlic before but to night it is delightful there is peace in its smell i feel sleep coming already good night everybody dr seward s diary september called at the berkeley and found van helsing as usual up to time the carriage ordered from the hotel was waiting the professor took his bag which he always brings with him now let all be put down exactly van helsing and i arrived at hillingham at eight o clock it was a lovely morning the bright sunshine and all the fresh feeling of early autumn seemed like the completion of nature s annual work the leaves were turning to all kinds of beautiful colours but had not yet begun to drop from the trees when we entered we met mrs westenra coming out of the morning room she is always an early riser she greeted us warmly and said you will be glad to know that lucy is better the dear child is still asleep i looked into her room and saw her but did not go in lest i should disturb her the professor smiled and looked quite jubilant he rubbed his hands together and said aha i thought i had diagnosed the case my treatment is working to which she answered you must not take all the credit to yourself doctor lucy s state this morning is due in part to me how you do mean ma am asked the professor well i was anxious about the dear child in the night and went into her room she was sleeping soundly so soundly that even my coming did not wake her but the room was awfully stuffy there were a lot of those horrible strong smelling flowers about everywhere and she had actually a bunch of them round her neck i feared that the heavy odour would be too much for the dear child in her weak state so i took them all away and opened a bit of the window to let in a little fresh air you will be pleased with her i am sure she moved off into her boudoir where she usually breakfasted early as she had spoken i watched the professor s face and saw it turn ashen grey he had been able to retain his self command whilst the poor lady was present for he knew her state and how mischievous a shock would be he actually smiled on her as he held open the door for her to pass into her room but the instant she had disappeared he pulled me suddenly and forcibly into the dining room and closed the door then for the first time in my life i saw van helsing break down he raised his hands over his head in a sort of mute despair and then beat his palms together in a helpless way finally he sat down on a chair and putting his hands before his face began to sob with loud dry sobs that seemed to come from the very racking of his heart then he raised his arms again as though appealing to the whole universe god god god he said what have we done what has this poor thing done that we are so sore beset is there fate amongst us still sent down from the pagan world of old that such things must be and in such way this poor mother all unknowing and all for the best as she think does such thing as lose her daughter body and soul and we must not tell her we must not even warn her or she die and then both die oh how we are beset how are all the powers of the devils against us suddenly he jumped to his feet come he said come we must see and act devils or no devils or all the devils at once it matters not we fight him all the same he went to the hall door for his bag and together we went up to lucy s room once again i drew up the blind whilst van helsing went towards the bed this time he did not start as he looked on the poor face with the same awful waxen pallor as before he wore a look of stern sadness and infinite pity as i expected he murmured with that hissing inspiration of his which meant so much without a word he went and locked the door and then began to set out on the little table the instruments for yet another operation of transfusion of blood i had long ago recognised the necessity and begun to take off my coat but he stopped me with a warning hand no he said to day you must operate i shall provide you are weakened already as he spoke he took off his coat and rolled up his shirt sleeve again the operation again the narcotic again some return of colour to the ashy cheeks and the regular breathing of healthy sleep this time i watched whilst van helsing recruited himself and rested presently he took an opportunity of telling mrs westenra that she must not remove anything from lucy s room without consulting him that the flowers were of medicinal value and that the breathing of their odour was a part of the system of cure then he took over the care of the case himself saying that he would watch this night and the next and would send me word when to come after another hour lucy waked from her sleep fresh and bright and seemingly not much the worse for her terrible ordeal what does it all mean i am beginning to wonder if my long habit of life amongst the insane is beginning to tell upon my own brain lucy westenra s diary september four days and nights of peace i am getting so strong again that i hardly know myself it is as if i had passed through some long nightmare and had just awakened to see the beautiful sunshine and feel the fresh air of the morning around me i have a dim half remembrance of long anxious times of waiting and fearing darkness in which there was not even the pain of hope to make present distress more poignant and then long spells of oblivion and the rising back to life as a diver coming up through a great press of water since however dr van helsing has been with me all this bad dreaming seems to have passed away the noises that used to frighten me out of my wits the flapping against the windows the distant voices which seemed so close to me the harsh sounds that came from i know not where and commanded me to do i know not what have all ceased i go to bed now without any fear of sleep i do not even try to keep awake i have grown quite fond of the garlic and a boxful arrives for me every day from haarlem to night dr van helsing is going away as he has to be for a day in amsterdam but i need not be watched i am well enough to be left alone thank god for mother s sake and dear arthur s and for all our friends who have been so kind i shall not even feel the change for last night dr van helsing slept in his chair a lot of the time i found him asleep twice when i awoke but i did not fear to go to sleep again although the boughs or bats or something napped almost angrily against the window panes the pall mall gazette september the escaped wolf perilous adventure of our interviewer interview with the keeper in the zo logical gardens after many inquiries and almost as many refusals and perpetually using the words pall mall gazette as a sort of talisman i managed to find the keeper of the section of the zo logical gardens in which the wolf department is included thomas bilder lives in one of the cottages in the enclosure behind the elephant house and was just sitting down to his tea when i found him thomas and his wife are hospitable folk elderly and without children and if the specimen i enjoyed of their hospitality be of the average kind their lives must be pretty comfortable the keeper would not enter on what he called business until the supper was over and we were all satisfied then when the table was cleared and he had lit his pipe he said now sir you can go on and arsk me what you want you ll excoose me refoosin to talk of perfeshunal subjects afore meals i gives the wolves and the jackals and the hyenas in all our section their tea afore i begins to arsk them questions how do you mean ask them questions i queried wishful to get him into a talkative humour ittin of them over the ead with a pole is one way scratchin of their hears is another when gents as is flush wants a bit of a show orf to their gals i don t so much mind the fust the ittin with a pole afore i chucks in their dinner but i waits till they ve ad their sherry and kawffee so to speak afore i tries on with the ear scratchin mind you he added philosophically there s a deal of the same nature in us as in them theer animiles here s you a comin and arskin of me questions about my business and i that grumpy like that only for your bloomin arf quid i d a seen you blowed fust fore i d answer not even when you arsked me sarcastic like if i d like you to arsk the superintendent if you might arsk me questions without offence did i tell yer to go to ell you did an when you said you d report me for usin of obscene language that was ittin me over the ead but the arf quid made that all right i weren t a goin to fight so i waited for the food and did with my owl as the wolves and lions and tigers does but lor love yer art now that the old ooman has stuck a chunk of her tea cake in me an rinsed me out with her bloomin old teapot and i ve lit hup you may scratch my ears for all you re worth and won t git even a growl out of me drive along with your questions i know what yer a comin at that ere escaped wolf exactly i want you to give me your view of it just tell me how it happened and when i know the facts i ll get you to say what you consider was the cause of it and how you think the whole affair will end all right guv nor this ere is about the ole story that ere wolf what we called bersicker was one of three grey ones that came from norway to jamrach s which we bought off him four years ago he was a nice well behaved wolf that never gave no trouble to talk of i m more surprised at im for wantin to get out nor any other animile in the place but there you can t trust wolves no more nor women don t you mind him sir broke in mrs tom with a cheery laugh e s got mindin the animiles so long that blest if he ain t like a old wolf isself but there ain t no arm in im well sir it was about two hours after feedin yesterday when i first hear my disturbance i was makin up a litter in the monkey house for a young puma which is ill but when i heard the yelpin and owlin i kem away straight there was bersicker a tearin like a mad thing at the bars as if he wanted to get out there wasn t much people about that day and close at hand was only one man a tall thin chap with a ook nose and a pointed beard with a few white hairs runnin through it he had a ard cold look and red eyes and i took a sort of mislike to him for it seemed as if it was im as they was hirritated at he ad white kid gloves on is ands and he pointed out the animiles to me and says keeper these wolves seem upset at something maybe it s you says i for i did not like the airs as he give isself he didn t git angry as i oped he would but he smiled a kind of insolent smile with a mouth full of white sharp teeth oh no they wouldn t like me e says ow yes they would says i a imitatin of him they always likes a bone or two to clean their teeth on about tea time which you as a bagful well it was a odd thing but when the animiles see us a talkin they lay down and when i went over to bersicker he let me stroke his ears same as ever that there man kem over and blessed but if he didn t put in his hand and stroke the old wolf s ears too tyke care says i bersicker is quick never mind he says i m used to em are you in the business yourself i says tyking off my at for a man what trades in wolves anceterer is a good friend to keepers no says he not exactly in the business but i ave made pets of several and with that he lifts his at as perlite as a lord and walks away old bersicker kep a lookin arter im till e was out of sight and then went and lay down in a corner and wouldn t come hout the ole hevening well larst night so soon as the moon was hup the wolves here all began a owling there warn t nothing for them to owl at there warn t no one near except some one that was evidently a callin a dog somewheres out back of the gardings in the park road once or twice i went out to see that all was right and it was and then the owling stopped just before twelve o clock i just took a look round afore turnin in an bust me but when i kem opposite to old bersicker s cage i see the rails broken and twisted about and the cage empty and that s all i know for certing did any one else see anything one of our gard ners was a comin ome about that time from a armony when he sees a big grey dog comin out through the garding edges at least so he says but i don t give much for it myself for if he did e never said a word about it to his missis when e got ome and it was only after the escape of the wolf was made known and we had been up all night a huntin of the park for bersicker that he remembered seein anything my own belief was that the armony ad got into his ead now mr bilder can you account in any way for the escape of the wolf well sir he said with a suspicious sort of modesty i think i can but i don t know as ow you d be satisfied with the theory certainly i shall if a man like you who knows the animals from experience can t hazard a good guess at any rate who is even to try well then sir i accounts for it this way it seems to me that ere wolf escaped simply because he wanted to get out from the hearty way that both thomas and his wife laughed at the joke i could see that it had done service before and that the whole explanation was simply an elaborate sell i couldn t cope in badinage with the worthy thomas but i thought i knew a surer way to his heart so i said now mr bilder we ll consider that first half sovereign worked off and this brother of his is waiting to be claimed when you ve told me what you think will happen right y are sir he said briskly ye ll excoose me i know for a chaffin of ye but the old woman here winked at me which was as much as telling me to go on well i never said the old lady my opinion is this that ere wolf is a idin of somewheres the gard ner wot didn t remember said he was a gallopin northward faster than a horse could go but i don t believe him for yer see sir wolves don t gallop no more nor dogs does they not bein built that way wolves is fine things in a storybook and i dessay when they gets in packs and does be chivyin somethin that s more afeared than they is they can make a devil of a noise and chop it up whatever it is but lor bless you in real life a wolf is only a low creature not half so clever or bold as a good dog and not half a quarter so much fight in im this one ain t been used to fightin or even to providin for hisself and more like he s somewhere round the park a idin an a shiverin of and if he thinks at all wonderin where he is to get his breakfast from or maybe he s got down some area and is in a coal cellar my eye won t some cook get a rum start when she sees his green eyes a shining at her out of the dark if he can t get food he s bound to look for it and mayhap he may chance to light on a butcher s shop in time if he doesn t and some nursemaid goes a walkin orf with a soldier leavin of the hinfant in the perambulator well then i shouldn t be surprised if the census is one babby the less that s all i was handing him the half sovereign when something came bobbing up against the window and mr bilder s face doubled its natural length with surprise god bless me he said if there ain t old bersicker come back by isself he went to the door and opened it a most unnecessary proceeding it seemed to me i have always thought that a wild animal never looks so well as when some obstacle of pronounced durability is between us a personal experience has intensified rather than diminished that idea after all however there is nothing like custom for neither bilder nor his wife thought any more of the wolf than i should of a dog the animal itself was as peaceful and well behaved as that father of all picture wolves red riding hood s quondam friend whilst moving her confidence in masquerade the whole scene was an unutterable mixture of comedy and pathos the wicked wolf that for half a day had paralysed london and set all the children in the town shivering in their shoes was there in a sort of penitent mood and was received and petted like a sort of vulpine prodigal son old bilder examined him all over with most tender solicitude and when he had finished with his penitent said there i knew the poor old chap would get into some kind of trouble didn t i say it all along here s his head all cut and full of broken glass e s been a gettin over some bloomin wall or other it s a shyme that people are allowed to top their walls with broken bottles this ere s what comes of it come along bersicker he took the wolf and locked him up in a cage with a piece of meat that satisfied in quantity at any rate the elementary conditions of the fatted calf and went off to report i came off too to report the only exclusive information that is given to day regarding the strange escapade at the zoo dr seward s diary september i was engaged after dinner in my study posting up my books which through press of other work and the many visits to lucy had fallen sadly into arrear suddenly the door was burst open and in rushed my patient with his face distorted with passion i was thunderstruck for such a thing as a patient getting of his own accord into the superintendent s study is almost unknown without an instant s pause he made straight at me he had a dinner knife in his hand and as i saw he was dangerous i tried to keep the table between us he was too quick and too strong for me however for before i could get my balance he had struck at me and cut my left wrist rather severely before he could strike again however i got in my right and he was sprawling on his back on the floor my wrist bled freely and quite a little pool trickled on to the carpet i saw that my friend was not intent on further effort and occupied myself binding up my wrist keeping a wary eye on the prostrate figure all the time when the attendants rushed in and we turned our attention to him his employment positively sickened me he was lying on his belly on the floor licking up like a dog the blood which had fallen from my wounded wrist he was easily secured and to my surprise went with the attendants quite placidly simply repeating over and over again the blood is the life the blood is the life i cannot afford to lose blood just at present i have lost too much of late for my physical good and then the prolonged strain of lucy s illness and its horrible phases is telling on me i am over excited and weary and i need rest rest rest happily van helsing has not summoned me so i need not forego my sleep to night i could not well do without it telegram van helsing antwerp to seward carfax sent to carfax sussex as no county given delivered late by twenty two hours september do not fail to be at hillingham to night if not watching all the time frequently visit and see that flowers are as placed very important do not fail shall be with you as soon as possible after arrival dr seward s diary september just off for train to london the arrival of van helsing s telegram filled me with dismay a whole night lost and i know by bitter experience what may happen in a night of course it is possible that all may be well but what may have happened surely there is some horrible doom hanging over us that every possible accident should thwart us in all we try to do i shall take this cylinder with me and then i can complete my entry on lucy s phonograph memorandum left by lucy westenra september night i write this and leave it to be seen so that no one may by any chance get into trouble through me this is an exact record of what took place to night i feel i am dying of weakness and have barely strength to write but it must be done if i die in the doing i went to bed as usual taking care that the flowers were placed as dr van helsing directed and soon fell asleep i was waked by the flapping at the window which had begun after that sleep walking on the cliff at whitby when mina saved me and which now i know so well i was not afraid but i did wish that dr seward was in the next room as dr van helsing said he would be so that i might have called him i tried to go to sleep but could not then there came to me the old fear of sleep and i determined to keep awake perversely sleep would try to come then when i did not want it so as i feared to be alone i opened my door and called out is there anybody there there was no answer i was afraid to wake mother and so closed my door again then outside in the shrubbery i heard a sort of howl like a dog s but more fierce and deeper i went to the window and looked out but could see nothing except a big bat which had evidently been buffeting its wings against the window so i went back to bed again but determined not to go to sleep presently the door opened and mother looked in seeing by my moving that i was not asleep came in and sat by me she said to me even more sweetly and softly than her wont i was uneasy about you darling and came in to see that you were all right i feared she might catch cold sitting there and asked her to come in and sleep with me so she came into bed and lay down beside me she did not take off her dressing gown for she said she would only stay a while and then go back to her own bed as she lay there in my arms and i in hers the flapping and buffeting came to the window again she was startled and a little frightened and cried out what is that i tried to pacify her and at last succeeded and she lay quiet but i could hear her poor dear heart still beating terribly after a while there was the low howl again out in the shrubbery and shortly after there was a crash at the window and a lot of broken glass was hurled on the floor the window blind blew back with the wind that rushed in and in the aperture of the broken panes there was the head of a great gaunt grey wolf mother cried out in a fright and struggled up into a sitting posture and clutched wildly at anything that would help her amongst other things she clutched the wreath of flowers that dr van helsing insisted on my wearing round my neck and tore it away from me for a second or two she sat up pointing at the wolf and there was a strange and horrible gurgling in her throat then she fell over as if struck with lightning and her head hit my forehead and made me dizzy for a moment or two the room and all round seemed to spin round i kept my eyes fixed on the window but the wolf drew his head back and a whole myriad of little specks seemed to come blowing in through the broken window and wheeling and circling round like the pillar of dust that travellers describe when there is a simoon in the desert i tried to stir but there was some spell upon me and dear mother s poor body which seemed to grow cold already for her dear heart had ceased to beat weighed me down and i remembered no more for a while the time did not seem long but very very awful till i recovered consciousness again somewhere near a passing bell was tolling the dogs all round the neighbourhood were howling and in our shrubbery seemingly just outside a nightingale was singing i was dazed and stupid with pain and terror and weakness but the sound of the nightingale seemed like the voice of my dead mother come back to comfort me the sounds seemed to have awakened the maids too for i could hear their bare feet pattering outside my door i called to them and they came in and when they saw what had happened and what it was that lay over me on the bed they screamed out the wind rushed in through the broken window and the door slammed to they lifted off the body of my dear mother and laid her covered up with a sheet on the bed after i had got up they were all so frightened and nervous that i directed them to go to the dining room and have each a glass of wine the door flew open for an instant and closed again the maids shrieked and then went in a body to the dining room and i laid what flowers i had on my dear mother s breast when they were there i remembered what dr van helsing had told me but i didn t like to remove them and besides i would have some of the servants to sit up with me now i was surprised that the maids did not come back i called them but got no answer so i went to the dining room to look for them my heart sank when i saw what had happened they all four lay helpless on the floor breathing heavily the decanter of sherry was on the table half full but there was a queer acrid smell about i was suspicious and examined the decanter it smelt of laudanum and looking on the sideboard i found that the bottle which mother s doctor uses for her oh did use was empty what am i to do what am i to do i am back in the room with mother i cannot leave her and i am alone save for the sleeping servants whom some one has drugged alone with the dead i dare not go out for i can hear the low howl of the wolf through the broken window the air seems full of specks floating and circling in the draught from the window and the lights burn blue and dim what am i to do god shield me from harm this night i shall hide this paper in my breast where they shall find it when they come to lay me out my dear mother gone it is time that i go too good bye dear arthur if i should not survive this night god keep you dear and god help me chapter xii dr seward s diary september i drove at once to hillingham and arrived early keeping my cab at the gate i went up the avenue alone i knocked gently and rang as quietly as possible for i feared to disturb lucy or her mother and hoped to only bring a servant to the door after a while finding no response i knocked and rang again still no answer i cursed the laziness of the servants that they should lie abed at such an hour for it was now ten o clock and so rang and knocked again but more impatiently but still without response hitherto i had blamed only the servants but now a terrible fear began to assail me was this desolation but another link in the chain of doom which seemed drawing tight around us was it indeed a house of death to which i had come too late i knew that minutes even seconds of delay might mean hours of danger to lucy if she had had again one of those frightful relapses and i went round the house to try if i could find by chance an entry anywhere i could find no means of ingress every window and door was fastened and locked and i returned baffled to the porch as i did so i heard the rapid pit pat of a swiftly driven horse s feet they stopped at the gate and a few seconds later i met van helsing running up the avenue when he saw me he gasped out then it was you and just arrived how is she are we too late did you not get my telegram i answered as quickly and coherently as i could that i had only got his telegram early in the morning and had not lost a minute in coming here and that i could not make any one in the house hear me he paused and raised his hat as he said solemnly then i fear we are too late god s will be done with his usual recuperative energy he went on come if there be no way open to get in we must make one time is all in all to us now we went round to the back of the house where there was a kitchen window the professor took a small surgical saw from his case and handing it to me pointed to the iron bars which guarded the window i attacked them at once and had very soon cut through three of them then with a long thin knife we pushed back the fastening of the sashes and opened the window i helped the professor in and followed him there was no one in the kitchen or in the servants rooms which were close at hand we tried all the rooms as we went along and in the dining room dimly lit by rays of light through the shutters found four servant women lying on the floor there was no need to think them dead for their stertorous breathing and the acrid smell of laudanum in the room left no doubt as to their condition van helsing and i looked at each other and as we moved away he said we can attend to them later then we ascended to lucy s room for an instant or two we paused at the door to listen but there was no sound that we could hear with white faces and trembling hands we opened the door gently and entered the room how shall i describe what we saw on the bed lay two women lucy and her mother the latter lay farthest in and she was covered with a white sheet the edge of which had been blown back by the draught through the broken window showing the drawn white face with a look of terror fixed upon it by her side lay lucy with face white and still more drawn the flowers which had been round her neck we found upon her mother s bosom and her throat was bare showing the two little wounds which we had noticed before but looking horribly white and mangled without a word the professor bent over the bed his head almost touching poor lucy s breast then he gave a quick turn of his head as of one who listens and leaping to his feet he cried out to me it is not yet too late quick quick bring the brandy i flew downstairs and returned with it taking care to smell and taste it lest it too were drugged like the decanter of sherry which i found on the table the maids were still breathing but more restlessly and i fancied that the narcotic was wearing off i did not stay to make sure but returned to van helsing he rubbed the brandy as on another occasion on her lips and gums and on her wrists and the palms of her hands he said to me i can do this all that can be at the present you go wake those maids flick them in the face with a wet towel and flick them hard make them get heat and fire and a warm bath this poor soul is nearly as cold as that beside her she will need be heated before we can do anything more i went at once and found little difficulty in waking three of the women the fourth was only a young girl and the drug had evidently affected her more strongly so i lifted her on the sofa and let her sleep the others were dazed at first but as remembrance came back to them they cried and sobbed in a hysterical manner i was stern with them however and would not let them talk i told them that one life was bad enough to lose and that if they delayed they would sacrifice miss lucy so sobbing and crying they went about their way half clad as they were and prepared fire and water fortunately the kitchen and boiler fires were still alive and there was no lack of hot water we got a bath and carried lucy out as she was and placed her in it whilst we were busy chafing her limbs there was a knock at the hall door one of the maids ran off hurried on some more clothes and opened it then she returned and whispered to us that there was a gentleman who had come with a message from mr holmwood i bade her simply tell him that he must wait for we could see no one now she went away with the message and engrossed with our work i clean forgot all about him i never saw in all my experience the professor work in such deadly earnest i knew as he knew that it was a stand up fight with death and in a pause told him so he answered me in a way that i did not understand but with the sternest look that his face could wear if that were all i would stop here where we are now and let her fade away into peace for i see no light in life over her horizon he went on with his work with if possible renewed and more frenzied vigour presently we both began to be conscious that the heat was beginning to be of some effect lucy s heart beat a trifle more audibly to the stethoscope and her lungs had a perceptible movement van helsing s face almost beamed and as we lifted her from the bath and rolled her in a hot sheet to dry her he said to me the first gain is ours check to the king we took lucy into another room which had by now been prepared and laid her in bed and forced a few drops of brandy down her throat i noticed that van helsing tied a soft silk handkerchief round her throat she was still unconscious and was quite as bad as if not worse than we had ever seen her van helsing called in one of the women and told her to stay with her and not to take her eyes off her till we returned and then beckoned me out of the room we must consult as to what is to be done he said as we descended the stairs in the hall he opened the dining room door and we passed in he closing the door carefully behind him the shutters had been opened but the blinds were already down with that obedience to the etiquette of death which the british woman of the lower classes always rigidly observes the room was therefore dimly dark it was however light enough for our purposes van helsing s sternness was somewhat relieved by a look of perplexity he was evidently torturing his mind about something so i waited for an instant and he spoke what are we to do now where are we to turn for help we must have another transfusion of blood and that soon or that poor girl s life won t be worth an hour s purchase you are exhausted already i am exhausted too i fear to trust those women even if they would have courage to submit what are we to do for some one who will open his veins for her what s the matter with me anyhow the voice came from the sofa across the room and its tones brought relief and joy to my heart for they were those of quincey morris van helsing started angrily at the first sound but his face softened and a glad look came into his eyes as i cried out quincey morris and rushed towards him with outstretched hands what brought you here i cried as our hands met i guess art is the cause he handed me a telegram have not heard from seward for three days and am terribly anxious cannot leave father still in same condition send me word how lucy is do not delay holmwood i think i came just in the nick of time you know you have only to tell me what to do van helsing strode forward and took his hand looking him straight in the eyes as he said a brave man s blood is the best thing on this earth when a woman is in trouble you re a man and no mistake well the devil may work against us for all he s worth but god sends us men when we want them once again we went through that ghastly operation i have not the heart to go through with the details lucy had got a terrible shock and it told on her more than before for though plenty of blood went into her veins her body did not respond to the treatment as well as on the other occasions her struggle back into life was something frightful to see and hear however the action of both heart and lungs improved and van helsing made a subcutaneous injection of morphia as before and with good effect her faint became a profound slumber the professor watched whilst i went downstairs with quincey morris and sent one of the maids to pay off one of the cabmen who were waiting i left quincey lying down after having a glass of wine and told the cook to get ready a good breakfast then a thought struck me and i went back to the room where lucy now was when i came softly in i found van helsing with a sheet or two of note paper in his hand he had evidently read it and was thinking it over as he sat with his hand to his brow there was a look of grim satisfaction in his face as of one who has had a doubt solved he handed me the paper saying only it dropped from lucy s breast when we carried her to the bath when i had read it i stood looking at the professor and after a pause asked him in god s name what does it all mean was she or is she mad or what sort of horrible danger is it i was so bewildered that i did not know what to say more van helsing put out his hand and took the paper saying do not trouble about it now forget it for the present you shall know and understand it all in good time but it will be later and now what is it that you came to me to say this brought me back to fact and i was all myself again i came to speak about the certificate of death if we do not act properly and wisely there may be an inquest and that paper would have to be produced i am in hopes that we need have no inquest for if we had it would surely kill poor lucy if nothing else did i know and you know and the other doctor who attended her knows that mrs westenra had disease of the heart and we can certify that she died of it let us fill up the certificate at once and i shall take it myself to the registrar and go on to the undertaker good oh my friend john well thought of truly miss lucy if she be sad in the foes that beset her is at least happy in the friends that love her one two three all open their veins for her besides one old man ah yes i know friend john i am not blind i love you all the more for it now go in the hall i met quincey morris with a telegram for arthur telling him that mrs westenra was dead that lucy also had been ill but was now going on better and that van helsing and i were with her i told him where i was going and he hurried me out but as i was going said when you come back jack may i have two words with you all to ourselves i nodded in reply and went out i found no difficulty about the registration and arranged with the local undertaker to come up in the evening to measure for the coffin and to make arrangements when i got back quincey was waiting for me i told him i would see him as soon as i knew about lucy and went up to her room she was still sleeping and the professor seemingly had not moved from his seat at her side from his putting his finger to his lips i gathered that he expected her to wake before long and was afraid of forestalling nature so i went down to quincey and took him into the breakfast room where the blinds were not drawn down and which was a little more cheerful or rather less cheerless than the other rooms when we were alone he said to me jack seward i don t want to shove myself in anywhere where i ve no right to be but this is no ordinary case you know i loved that girl and wanted to marry her but although that s all past and gone i can t help feeling anxious about her all the same what is it that s wrong with her the dutchman and a fine old fellow he is i can see that said that time you two came into the room that you must have another transfusion of blood and that both you and he were exhausted now i know well that you medical men speak in camera and that a man must not expect to know what they consult about in private but this is no common matter and whatever it is i have done my part is not that so that s so i said and he went on i take it that both you and van helsing had done already what i did to day is not that so that s so and i guess art was in it too when i saw him four days ago down at his own place he looked queer i have not seen anything pulled down so quick since i was on the pampas and had a mare that i was fond of go to grass all in a night one of those big bats that they call vampires had got at her in the night and what with his gorge and the vein left open there wasn t enough blood in her to let her stand up and i had to put a bullet through her as she lay jack if you may tell me without betraying confidence arthur was the first is not that so as he spoke the poor fellow looked terribly anxious he was in a torture of suspense regarding the woman he loved and his utter ignorance of the terrible mystery which seemed to surround her intensified his pain his very heart was bleeding and it took all the manhood of him and there was a royal lot of it too to keep him from breaking down i paused before answering for i felt that i must not betray anything which the professor wished kept secret but already he knew so much and guessed so much that there could be no reason for not answering so i answered in the same phrase that s so and how long has this been going on about ten days ten days then i guess jack seward that that poor pretty creature that we all love has had put into her veins within that time the blood of four strong men man alive her whole body wouldn t hold it then coming close to me he spoke in a fierce half whisper what took it out i shook my head that i said is the crux van helsing is simply frantic about it and i am at my wits end i can t even hazard a guess there has been a series of little circumstances which have thrown out all our calculations as to lucy being properly watched but these shall not occur again here we stay until all be well or ill quincey held out his hand count me in he said you and the dutchman will tell me what to do and i ll do it when she woke late in the afternoon lucy s first movement was to feel in her breast and to my surprise produced the paper which van helsing had given me to read the careful professor had replaced it where it had come from lest on waking she should be alarmed her eye then lit on van helsing and on me too and gladdened then she looked around the room and seeing where she was shuddered she gave a loud cry and put her poor thin hands before her pale face we both understood what that meant that she had realised to the full her mother s death so we tried what we could to comfort her doubtless sympathy eased her somewhat but she was very low in thought and spirit and wept silently and weakly for a long time we told her that either or both of us would now remain with her all the time and that seemed to comfort her towards dusk she fell into a doze here a very odd thing occurred whilst still asleep she took the paper from her breast and tore it in two van helsing stepped over and took the pieces from her all the same however she went on with the action of tearing as though the material were still in her hands finally she lifted her hands and opened them as though scattering the fragments van helsing seemed surprised and his brows gathered as if in thought but he said nothing september all last night she slept fitfully being always afraid to sleep and something weaker when she woke from it the professor and i took it in turns to watch and we never left her for a moment unattended quincey morris said nothing about his intention but i knew that all night long he patrolled round and round the house when the day came its searching light showed the ravages in poor lucy s strength she was hardly able to turn her head and the little nourishment which she could take seemed to do her no good at times she slept and both van helsing and i noticed the difference in her between sleeping and waking whilst asleep she looked stronger although more haggard and her breathing was softer her open mouth showed the pale gums drawn back from the teeth which thus looked positively longer and sharper than usual when she woke the softness of her eyes evidently changed the expression for she looked her own self although a dying one in the afternoon she asked for arthur and we telegraphed for him quincey went off to meet him at the station when he arrived it was nearly six o clock and the sun was setting full and warm and the red light streamed in through the window and gave more colour to the pale cheeks when he saw her arthur was simply choking with emotion and none of us could speak in the hours that had passed the fits of sleep or the comatose condition that passed for it had grown more frequent so that the pauses when conversation was possible were shortened arthur s presence however seemed to act as a stimulant she rallied a little and spoke to him more brightly than she had done since we arrived he too pulled himself together and spoke as cheerily as he could so that the best was made of everything it was now nearly one o clock and he and van helsing are sitting with her i am to relieve them in a quarter of an hour and i am entering this on lucy s phonograph until six o clock they are to try to rest i fear that to morrow will end our watching for the shock has been too great the poor child cannot rally god help us all letter mina harker to lucy westenra unopened by her september my dearest lucy it seems an age since i heard from you or indeed since i wrote you will pardon me i know for all my faults when you have read all my budget of news well i got my husband back all right when we arrived at exeter there was a carriage waiting for us and in it though he had an attack of gout mr hawkins he took us to his house where there were rooms for us all nice and comfortable and we dined together after dinner mr hawkins said my dears i want to drink your health and prosperity and may every blessing attend you both i know you both from children and have with love and pride seen you grow up now i want you to make your home here with me i have left to me neither chick nor child all are gone and in my will i have left you everything i cried lucy dear as jonathan and the old man clasped hands our evening was a very very happy one so here we are installed in this beautiful old house and from both my bedroom and the drawing room i can see the great elms of the cathedral close with their great black stems standing out against the old yellow stone of the cathedral and i can hear the rooks overhead cawing and cawing and chattering and gossiping all day after the manner of rooks and humans i am busy i need not tell you arranging things and housekeeping jonathan and mr hawkins are busy all day for now that jonathan is a partner mr hawkins wants to tell him all about the clients how is your dear mother getting on i wish i could run up to town for a day or two to see you dear but i dare not go yet with so much on my shoulders and jonathan wants looking after still he is beginning to put some flesh on his bones again but he was terribly weakened by the long illness even now he sometimes starts out of his sleep in a sudden way and awakes all trembling until i can coax him back to his usual placidity however thank god these occasions grow less frequent as the days go on and they will in time pass away altogether i trust and now i have told you my news let me ask yours when are you to be married and where and who is to perform the ceremony and what are you to wear and is it to be a public or a private wedding tell me all about it dear tell me all about everything for there is nothing which interests you which will not be dear to me jonathan asks me to send his respectful duty but i do not think that is good enough from the junior partner of the important firm hawkins harker and so as you love me and he loves me and i love you with all the moods and tenses of the verb i send you simply his love instead good bye my dearest lucy and all blessings on you yours mina harker report from patrick hennessey m d m r c s l k q c p i etc etc to john seward m d september my dear sir in accordance with your wishes i enclose report of the conditions of everything left in my charge with regard to patient renfield there is more to say he has had another outbreak which might have had a dreadful ending but which as it fortunately happened was unattended with any unhappy results this afternoon a carrier s cart with two men made a call at the empty house whose grounds abut on ours the house to which you will remember the patient twice ran away the men stopped at our gate to ask the porter their way as they were strangers i was myself looking out of the study window having a smoke after dinner and saw one of them come up to the house as he passed the window of renfield s room the patient began to rate him from within and called him all the foul names he could lay his tongue to the man who seemed a decent fellow enough contented himself by telling him to shut up for a foul mouthed beggar whereon our man accused him of robbing him and wanting to murder him and said that he would hinder him if he were to swing for it i opened the window and signed to the man not to notice so he contented himself after looking the place over and making up his mind as to what kind of a place he had got to by saying lor bless yer sir i wouldn t mind what was said to me in a bloomin madhouse i pity ye and the guv nor for havin to live in the house with a wild beast like that then he asked his way civilly enough and i told him where the gate of the empty house was he went away followed by threats and curses and revilings from our man i went down to see if i could make out any cause for his anger since he is usually such a well behaved man and except his violent fits nothing of the kind had ever occurred i found him to my astonishment quite composed and most genial in his manner i tried to get him to talk of the incident but he blandly asked me questions as to what i meant and led me to believe that he was completely oblivious of the affair it was i am sorry to say however only another instance of his cunning for within half an hour i heard of him again this time he had broken out through the window of his room and was running down the avenue i called to the attendants to follow me and ran after him for i feared he was intent on some mischief my fear was justified when i saw the same cart which had passed before coming down the road having on it some great wooden boxes the men were wiping their foreheads and were flushed in the face as if with violent exercise before i could get up to him the patient rushed at them and pulling one of them off the cart began to knock his head against the ground if i had not seized him just at the moment i believe he would have killed the man there and then the other fellow jumped down and struck him over the head with the butt end of his heavy whip it was a terrible blow but he did not seem to mind it but seized him also and struggled with the three of us pulling us to and fro as if we were kittens you know i am no light weight and the others were both burly men at first he was silent in his fighting but as we began to master him and the attendants were putting a strait waistcoat on him he began to shout i ll frustrate them they shan t rob me they shan t murder me by inches i ll fight for my lord and master and all sorts of similar incoherent ravings it was with very considerable difficulty that they got him back to the house and put him in the padded room one of the attendants hardy had a finger broken however i set it all right and he is going on well the two carriers were at first loud in their threats of actions for damages and promised to rain all the penalties of the law on us their threats were however mingled with some sort of indirect apology for the defeat of the two of them by a feeble madman they said that if it had not been for the way their strength had been spent in carrying and raising the heavy boxes to the cart they would have made short work of him they gave as another reason for their defeat the extraordinary state of drouth to which they had been reduced by the dusty nature of their occupation and the reprehensible distance from the scene of their labours of any place of public entertainment i quite understood their drift and after a stiff glass of grog or rather more of the same and with each a sovereign in hand they made light of the attack and swore that they would encounter a worse madman any day for the pleasure of meeting so bloomin good a bloke as your correspondent i took their names and addresses in case they might be needed they are as follows jack smollet of dudding s rents king george s road great walworth and thomas snelling peter farley s row guide court bethnal green they are both in the employment of harris sons moving and shipment company orange master s yard soho i shall report to you any matter of interest occurring here and shall wire you at once if there is anything of importance believe me dear sir yours faithfully patrick hennessey letter mina harker to lucy westenra unopened by her september my dearest lucy such a sad blow has befallen us mr hawkins has died very suddenly some may not think it so sad for us but we had both come to so love him that it really seems as though we had lost a father i never knew either father or mother so that the dear old man s death is a real blow to me jonathan is greatly distressed it is not only that he feels sorrow deep sorrow for the dear good man who has befriended him all his life and now at the end has treated him like his own son and left him a fortune which to people of our modest bringing up is wealth beyond the dream of avarice but jonathan feels it on another account he says the amount of responsibility which it puts upon him makes him nervous he begins to doubt himself i try to cheer him up and my belief in him helps him to have a belief in himself but it is here that the grave shock that he experienced tells upon him the most oh it is too hard that a sweet simple noble strong nature such as his a nature which enabled him by our dear good friend s aid to rise from clerk to master in a few years should be so injured that the very essence of its strength is gone forgive me dear if i worry you with my troubles in the midst of your own happiness but lucy dear i must tell some one for the strain of keeping up a brave and cheerful appearance to jonathan tries me and i have no one here that i can confide in i dread coming up to london as we must do the day after to morrow for poor mr hawkins left in his will that he was to be buried in the grave with his father as there are no relations at all jonathan will have to be chief mourner i shall try to run over to see you dearest if only for a few minutes forgive me for troubling you with all blessings your loving mina harker dr seward s diary september only resolution and habit can let me make an entry to night i am too miserable too low spirited too sick of the world and all in it including life itself that i would not care if i heard this moment the flapping of the wings of the angel of death and he has been flapping those grim wings to some purpose of late lucy s mother and arthur s father and now let me get on with my work i duly relieved van helsing in his watch over lucy we wanted arthur to go to rest also but he refused at first it was only when i told him that we should want him to help us during the day and that we must not all break down for want of rest lest lucy should suffer that he agreed to go van helsing was very kind to him come my child he said come with me you are sick and weak and have had much sorrow and much mental pain as well as that tax on your strength that we know of you must not be alone for to be alone is to be full of fears and alarms come to the drawing room where there is a big fire and there are two sofas you shall lie on one and i on the other and our sympathy will be comfort to each other even though we do not speak and even if we sleep arthur went off with him casting back a longing look on lucy s face which lay in her pillow almost whiter than the lawn she lay quite still and i looked round the room to see that all was as it should be i could see that the professor had carried out in this room as in the other his purpose of using the garlic the whole of the window sashes reeked with it and round lucy s neck over the silk handkerchief which van helsing made her keep on was a rough chaplet of the same odorous flowers lucy was breathing somewhat stertorously and her face was at its worst for the open mouth showed the pale gums her teeth in the dim uncertain light seemed longer and sharper than they had been in the morning in particular by some trick of the light the canine teeth looked longer and sharper than the rest i sat down by her and presently she moved uneasily at the same moment there came a sort of dull flapping or buffeting at the window i went over to it softly and peeped out by the corner of the blind there was a full moonlight and i could see that the noise was made by a great bat which wheeled round doubtless attracted by the light although so dim and every now and again struck the window with its wings when i came back to my seat i found that lucy had moved slightly and had torn away the garlic flowers from her throat i replaced them as well as i could and sat watching her presently she woke and i gave her food as van helsing had prescribed she took but a little and that languidly there did not seem to be with her now the unconscious struggle for life and strength that had hitherto so marked her illness it struck me as curious that the moment she became conscious she pressed the garlic flowers close to her it was certainly odd that whenever she got into that lethargic state with the stertorous breathing she put the flowers from her but that when she waked she clutched them close there was no possibility of making any mistake about this for in the long hours that followed she had many spells of sleeping and waking and repeated both actions many times at six o clock van helsing came to relieve me arthur had then fallen into a doze and he mercifully let him sleep on when he saw lucy s face i could hear the sissing indraw of his breath and he said to me in a sharp whisper draw up the blind i want light then he bent down and with his face almost touching lucy s examined her carefully he removed the flowers and lifted the silk handkerchief from her throat as he did so he started back and i could hear his ejaculation mein gott as it was smothered in his throat i bent over and looked too and as i noticed some queer chill came over me the wounds on the throat had absolutely disappeared for fully five minutes van helsing stood looking at her with his face at its sternest then he turned to me and said calmly she is dying it will not be long now it will be much difference mark me whether she dies conscious or in her sleep wake that poor boy and let him come and see the last he trusts us and we have promised him i went to the dining room and waked him he was dazed for a moment but when he saw the sunlight streaming in through the edges of the shutters he thought he was late and expressed his fear i assured him that lucy was still asleep but told him as gently as i could that both van helsing and i feared that the end was near he covered his face with his hands and slid down on his knees by the sofa where he remained perhaps a minute with his head buried praying whilst his shoulders shook with grief i took him by the hand and raised him up come i said my dear old fellow summon all your fortitude it will be best and easiest for her when we came into lucy s room i could see that van helsing had with his usual forethought been putting matters straight and making everything look as pleasing as possible he had even brushed lucy s hair so that it lay on the pillow in its usual sunny ripples when we came into the room she opened her eyes and seeing him whispered softly arthur oh my love i am so glad you have come he was stooping to kiss her when van helsing motioned him back no he whispered not yet hold her hand it will comfort her more so arthur took her hand and knelt beside her and she looked her best with all the soft lines matching the angelic beauty of her eyes then gradually her eyes closed and she sank to sleep for a little bit her breast heaved softly and her breath came and went like a tired child s and then insensibly there came the strange change which i had noticed in the night her breathing grew stertorous the mouth opened and the pale gums drawn back made the teeth look longer and sharper than ever in a sort of sleep waking vague unconscious way she opened her eyes which were now dull and hard at once and said in a soft voluptuous voice such as i had never heard from her lips arthur oh my love i am so glad you have come kiss me arthur bent eagerly over to kiss her but at that instant van helsing who like me had been startled by her voice swooped upon him and catching him by the neck with both hands dragged him back with a fury of strength which i never thought he could have possessed and actually hurled him almost across the room not for your life he said not for your living soul and hers and he stood between them like a lion at bay arthur was so taken aback that he did not for a moment know what to do or say and before any impulse of violence could seize him he realised the place and the occasion and stood silent waiting i kept my eyes fixed on lucy as did van helsing and we saw a spasm as of rage flit like a shadow over her face the sharp teeth champed together then her eyes closed and she breathed heavily very shortly after she opened her eyes in all their softness and putting out her poor pale thin hand took van helsing s great brown one drawing it to her she kissed it my true friend she said in a faint voice but with untellable pathos my true friend and his oh guard him and give me peace i swear it he said solemnly kneeling beside her and holding up his hand as one who registers an oath then he turned to arthur and said to him come my child take her hand in yours and kiss her on the forehead and only once their eyes met instead of their lips and so they parted lucy s eyes closed and van helsing who had been watching closely took arthur s arm and drew him away and then lucy s breathing became stertorous again and all at once it ceased it is all over said van helsing she is dead i took arthur by the arm and led him away to the drawing room where he sat down and covered his face with his hands sobbing in a way that nearly broke me down to see i went back to the room and found van helsing looking at poor lucy and his face was sterner than ever some change had come over her body death had given back part of her beauty for her brow and cheeks had recovered some of their flowing lines even the lips had lost their deadly pallor it was as if the blood no longer needed for the working of the heart had gone to make the harshness of death as little rude as might be we thought her dying whilst she slept and sleeping when she died i stood beside van helsing and said ah well poor girl there is peace for her at last it is the end he turned to me and said with grave solemnity not so alas not so it is only the beginning when i asked him what he meant he only shook his head and answered we can do nothing as yet wait and see chapter xiii dr seward s diary continued the funeral was arranged for the next succeeding day so that lucy and her mother might be buried together i attended to all the ghastly formalities and the urbane undertaker proved that his staff were afflicted or blessed with something of his own obsequious suavity even the woman who performed the last offices for the dead remarked to me in a confidential brother professional way when she had come out from the death chamber she makes a very beautiful corpse sir it s quite a privilege to attend on her it s not too much to say that she will do credit to our establishment i noticed that van helsing never kept far away this was possible from the disordered state of things in the household there were no relatives at hand and as arthur had to be back the next day to attend at his father s funeral we were unable to notify any one who should have been bidden under the circumstances van helsing and i took it upon ourselves to examine papers etc he insisted upon looking over lucy s papers himself i asked him why for i feared that he being a foreigner might not be quite aware of english legal requirements and so might in ignorance make some unnecessary trouble he answered me i know i know you forget that i am a lawyer as well as a doctor but this is not altogether for the law you knew that when you avoided the coroner i have more than him to avoid there may be papers more such as this as he spoke he took from his pocket book the memorandum which had been in lucy s breast and which she had torn in her sleep when you find anything of the solicitor who is for the late mrs westenra seal all her papers and write him to night for me i watch here in the room and in miss lucy s old room all night and i myself search for what may be it is not well that her very thoughts go into the hands of strangers i went on with my part of the work and in another half hour had found the name and address of mrs westenra s solicitor and had written to him all the poor lady s papers were in order explicit directions regarding the place of burial were given i had hardly sealed the letter when to my surprise van helsing walked into the room saying can i help you friend john i am free and if i may my service is to you have you got what you looked for i asked to which he replied i did not look for any specific thing i only hoped to find and find i have all that there was only some letters and a few memoranda and a diary new begun but i have them here and we shall for the present say nothing of them i shall see that poor lad to morrow evening and with his sanction i shall use some when we had finished the work in hand he said to me and now friend john i think we may to bed we want sleep both you and i and rest to recuperate to morrow we shall have much to do but for the to night there is no need of us alas before turning in we went to look at poor lucy the undertaker had certainly done his work well for the room was turned into a small chapelle ardente there was a wilderness of beautiful white flowers and death was made as little repulsive as might be the end of the winding sheet was laid over the face when the professor bent over and turned it gently back we both started at the beauty before us the tall wax candles showing a sufficient light to note it well all lucy s loveliness had come back to her in death and the hours that had passed instead of leaving traces of decay s effacing fingers had but restored the beauty of life till positively i could not believe my eyes that i was looking at a corpse the professor looked sternly grave he had not loved her as i had and there was no need for tears in his eyes he said to me remain till i return and left the room he came back with a handful of wild garlic from the box waiting in the hall but which had not been opened and placed the flowers amongst the others on and around the bed then he took from his neck inside his collar a little gold crucifix and placed it over the mouth he restored the sheet to its place and we came away i was undressing in my own room when with a premonitory tap at the door he entered and at once began to speak to morrow i want you to bring me before night a set of post mortem knives must we make an autopsy i asked yes and no i want to operate but not as you think let me tell you now but not a word to another i want to cut off her head and take out her heart ah you a surgeon and so shocked you whom i have seen with no tremble of hand or heart do operations of life and death that make the rest shudder oh but i must not forget my dear friend john that you loved her and i have not forgotten it for it is i that shall operate and you must only help i would like to do it to night but for arthur i must not he will be free after his father s funeral to morrow and he will want to see her to see it then when she is coffined ready for the next day you and i shall come when all sleep we shall unscrew the coffin lid and shall do our operation and then replace all so that none know save we alone but why do it at all the girl is dead why mutilate her poor body without need and if there is no necessity for a post mortem and nothing to gain by it no good to her to us to science to human knowledge why do it without such it is monstrous for answer he put his hand on my shoulder and said with infinite tenderness friend john i pity your poor bleeding heart and i love you the more because it does so bleed if i could i would take on myself the burden that you do bear but there are things that you know not but that you shall know and bless me for knowing though they are not pleasant things john my child you have been my friend now many years and yet did you ever know me to do any without good cause i may err i am but man but i believe in all i do was it not for these causes that you send for me when the great trouble came yes were you not amazed nay horrified when i would not let arthur kiss his love though she was dying and snatched him away by all my strength yes and yet you saw how she thanked me with her so beautiful dying eyes her voice too so weak and she kiss my rough old hand and bless me yes and did you not hear me swear promise to her that so she closed her eyes grateful yes well i have good reason now for all i want to do you have for many years trust me you have believe me weeks past when there be things so strange that you might have well doubt believe me yet a little friend john if you trust me not then i must tell what i think and that is not perhaps well and if i work as work i shall no matter trust or no trust without my friend trust in me i work with heavy heart and feel oh so lonely when i want all help and courage that may be he paused a moment and went on solemnly friend john there are strange and terrible days before us let us not be two but one that so we work to a good end will you not have faith in me i took his hand and promised him i held my door open as he went away and watched him go into his room and close the door as i stood without moving i saw one of the maids pass silently along the passage she had her back towards me so did not see me and go into the room where lucy lay the sight touched me devotion is so rare and we are so grateful to those who show it unasked to those we love here was a poor girl putting aside the terrors which she naturally had of death to go watch alone by the bier of the mistress whom she loved so that the poor clay might not be lonely till laid to eternal rest i must have slept long and soundly for it was broad daylight when van helsing waked me by coming into my room he came over to my bedside and said you need not trouble about the knives we shall not do it why not i asked for his solemnity of the night before had greatly impressed me because he said sternly it is too late or too early see here he held up the little golden crucifix this was stolen in the night how stolen i asked in wonder since you have it now because i get it back from the worthless wretch who stole it from the woman who robbed the dead and the living her punishment will surely come but not through me she knew not altogether what she did and thus unknowing she only stole now we must wait he went away on the word leaving me with a new mystery to think of a new puzzle to grapple with the forenoon was a dreary time but at noon the solicitor came mr marquand of wholeman sons marquand lidderdale he was very genial and very appreciative of what we had done and took off our hands all cares as to details during lunch he told us that mrs westenra had for some time expected sudden death from her heart and had put her affairs in absolute order he informed us that with the exception of a certain entailed property of lucy s father s which now in default of direct issue went back to a distant branch of the family the whole estate real and personal was left absolutely to arthur holmwood when he had told us so much he went on frankly we did our best to prevent such a testamentary disposition and pointed out certain contingencies that might leave her daughter either penniless or not so free as she should be to act regarding a matrimonial alliance indeed we pressed the matter so far that we almost came into collision for she asked us if we were or were not prepared to carry out her wishes of course we had then no alternative but to accept we were right in principle and ninety nine times out of a hundred we should have proved by the logic of events the accuracy of our judgment frankly however i must admit that in this case any other form of disposition would have rendered impossible the carrying out of her wishes for by her predeceasing her daughter the latter would have come into possession of the property and even had she only survived her mother by five minutes her property would in case there were no will and a will was a practical impossibility in such a case have been treated at her decease as under intestacy in which case lord godalming though so dear a friend would have had no claim in the world and the inheritors being remote would not be likely to abandon their just rights for sentimental reasons regarding an entire stranger i assure you my dear sirs i am rejoiced at the result perfectly rejoiced he was a good fellow but his rejoicing at the one little part in which he was officially interested of so great a tragedy was an object lesson in the limitations of sympathetic understanding he did not remain long but said he would look in later in the day and see lord godalming his coming however had been a certain comfort to us since it assured us that we should not have to dread hostile criticism as to any of our acts arthur was expected at five o clock so a little before that time we visited the death chamber it was so in very truth for now both mother and daughter lay in it the undertaker true to his craft had made the best display he could of his goods and there was a mortuary air about the place that lowered our spirits at once van helsing ordered the former arrangement to be adhered to explaining that as lord godalming was coming very soon it would be less harrowing to his feelings to see all that was left of his fianc e quite alone the undertaker seemed shocked at his own stupidity and exerted himself to restore things to the condition in which we left them the night before so that when arthur came such shocks to his feelings as we could avoid were saved poor fellow he looked desperately sad and broken even his stalwart manhood seemed to have shrunk somewhat under the strain of his much tried emotions he had i knew been very genuinely and devotedly attached to his father and to lose him and at such a time was a bitter blow to him with me he was warm as ever and to van helsing he was sweetly courteous but i could not help seeing that there was some constraint with him the professor noticed it too and motioned me to bring him upstairs i did so and left him at the door of the room as i felt he would like to be quite alone with her but he took my arm and led me in saying huskily you loved her too old fellow she told me all about it and there was no friend had a closer place in her heart than you i don t know how to thank you for all you have done for her i can t think yet here he suddenly broke down and threw his arms round my shoulders and laid his head on my breast crying oh jack jack what shall i do the whole of life seems gone from me all at once and there is nothing in the wide world for me to live for i comforted him as well as i could in such cases men do not need much expression a grip of the hand the tightening of an arm over the shoulder a sob in unison are expressions of sympathy dear to a man s heart i stood still and silent till his sobs died away and then i said softly to him come and look at her together we moved over to the bed and i lifted the lawn from her face god how beautiful she was every hour seemed to be enhancing her loveliness it frightened and amazed me somewhat and as for arthur he fell a trembling and finally was shaken with doubt as with an ague at last after a long pause he said to me in a faint whisper jack is she really dead i assured him sadly that it was so and went on to suggest for i felt that such a horrible doubt should not have life for a moment longer than i could help that it often happened that after death faces became softened and even resolved into their youthful beauty that this was especially so when death had been preceded by any acute or prolonged suffering it seemed to quite do away with any doubt and after kneeling beside the couch for a while and looking at her lovingly and long he turned aside i told him that that must be good bye as the coffin had to be prepared so he went back and took her dead hand in his and kissed it and bent over and kissed her forehead he came away fondly looking back over his shoulder at her as he came i left him in the drawing room and told van helsing that he had said good bye so the latter went to the kitchen to tell the undertaker s men to proceed with the preparations and to screw up the coffin when he came out of the room again i told him of arthur s question and he replied i am not surprised just now i doubted for a moment myself we all dined together and i could see that poor art was trying to make the best of things van helsing had been silent all dinner time but when we had lit our cigars he said lord but arthur interrupted him no no not that for god s sake not yet at any rate forgive me sir i did not mean to speak offensively it is only because my loss is so recent the professor answered very sweetly i only used that name because i was in doubt i must not call you mr and i have grown to love you yes my dear boy to love you as arthur arthur held out his hand and took the old man s warmly call me what you will he said i hope i may always have the title of a friend and let me say that i am at a loss for words to thank you for your goodness to my poor dear he paused a moment and went on i know that she understood your goodness even better than i do and if i was rude or in any way wanting at that time you acted so you remember the professor nodded you must forgive me he answered with a grave kindness i know it was hard for you to quite trust me then for to trust such violence needs to understand and i take it that you do not that you cannot trust me now for you do not yet understand and there may be more times when i shall want you to trust when you cannot and may not and must not yet understand but the time will come when your trust shall be whole and complete in me and when you shall understand as though the sunlight himself shone through then you shall bless me from first to last for your own sake and for the sake of others and for her dear sake to whom i swore to protect and indeed indeed sir said arthur warmly i shall in all ways trust you i know and believe you have a very noble heart and you are jack s friend and you were hers you shall do what you like the professor cleared his throat a couple of times as though about to speak and finally said may i ask you something now certainly you know that mrs westenra left you all her property no poor dear i never thought of it and as it is all yours you have a right to deal with it as you will i want you to give me permission to read all miss lucy s papers and letters believe me it is no idle curiosity i have a motive of which be sure she would have approved i have them all here i took them before we knew that all was yours so that no strange hand might touch them no strange eye look through words into her soul i shall keep them if i may even you may not see them yet but i shall keep them safe no word shall be lost and in the good time i shall give them back to you it s a hard thing i ask but you will do it will you not for lucy s sake arthur spoke out heartily like his old self dr van helsing you may do what you will i feel that in saying this i am doing what my dear one would have approved i shall not trouble you with questions till the time comes the old professor stood up as he said solemnly and you are right there will be pain for us all but it will not be all pain nor will this pain be the last we and you too you most of all my dear boy will have to pass through the bitter water before we reach the sweet but we must be brave of heart and unselfish and do our duty and all will be well i slept on a sofa in arthur s room that night van helsing did not go to bed at all he went to and fro as if patrolling the house and was never out of sight of the room where lucy lay in her coffin strewn with the wild garlic flowers which sent through the odour of lily and rose a heavy overpowering smell into the night mina harker s journal september in the train to exeter jonathan sleeping it seems only yesterday that the last entry was made and yet how much between then in whitby and all the world before me jonathan away and no news of him and now married to jonathan jonathan a solicitor a partner rich master of his business mr hawkins dead and buried and jonathan with another attack that may harm him some day he may ask me about it down it all goes i am rusty in my shorthand see what unexpected prosperity does for us so it may be as well to freshen it up again with an exercise anyhow the service was very simple and very solemn there were only ourselves and the servants there one or two old friends of his from exeter his london agent and a gentleman representing sir john paxton the president of the incorporated law society jonathan and i stood hand in hand and we felt that our best and dearest friend was gone from us we came back to town quietly taking a bus to hyde park corner jonathan thought it would interest me to go into the row for a while so we sat down but there were very few people there and it was sad looking and desolate to see so many empty chairs it made us think of the empty chair at home so we got up and walked down piccadilly jonathan was holding me by the arm the way he used to in old days before i went to school i felt it very improper for you can t go on for some years teaching etiquette and decorum to other girls without the pedantry of it biting into yourself a bit but it was jonathan and he was my husband and we didn t know anybody who saw us and we didn t care if they did so on we walked i was looking at a very beautiful girl in a big cart wheel hat sitting in a victoria outside guiliano s when i felt jonathan clutch my arm so tight that he hurt me and he said under his breath my god i am always anxious about jonathan for i fear that some nervous fit may upset him again so i turned to him quickly and asked him what it was that disturbed him he was very pale and his eyes seemed bulging out as half in terror and half in amazement he gazed at a tall thin man with a beaky nose and black moustache and pointed beard who was also observing the pretty girl he was looking at her so hard that he did not see either of us and so i had a good view of him his face was not a good face it was hard and cruel and sensual and his big white teeth that looked all the whiter because his lips were so red were pointed like an animal s jonathan kept staring at him till i was afraid he would notice i feared he might take it ill he looked so fierce and nasty i asked jonathan why he was disturbed and he answered evidently thinking that i knew as much about it as he did do you see who it is no dear i said i don t know him who is it his answer seemed to shock and thrill me for it was said as if he did not know that it was to me mina to whom he was speaking it is the man himself the poor dear was evidently terrified at something very greatly terrified i do believe that if he had not had me to lean on and to support him he would have sunk down he kept staring a man came out of the shop with a small parcel and gave it to the lady who then drove off the dark man kept his eyes fixed on her and when the carriage moved up piccadilly he followed in the same direction and hailed a hansom jonathan kept looking after him and said as if to himself i believe it is the count but he has grown young my god if this be so oh my god my god if i only knew if i only knew he was distressing himself so much that i feared to keep his mind on the subject by asking him any questions so i remained silent i drew him away quietly and he holding my arm came easily we walked a little further and then went in and sat for a while in the green park it was a hot day for autumn and there was a comfortable seat in a shady place after a few minutes staring at nothing jonathan s eyes closed and he went quietly into a sleep with his head on my shoulder i thought it was the best thing for him so did not disturb him in about twenty minutes he woke up and said to me quite cheerfully why mina have i been asleep oh do forgive me for being so rude come and we ll have a cup of tea somewhere he had evidently forgotten all about the dark stranger as in his illness he had forgotten all that this episode had reminded him of i don t like this lapsing into forgetfulness it may make or continue some injury to the brain i must not ask him for fear i shall do more harm than good but i must somehow learn the facts of his journey abroad the time is come i fear when i must open that parcel and know what is written oh jonathan you will i know forgive me if i do wrong but it is for your own dear sake later a sad home coming in every way the house empty of the dear soul who was so good to us jonathan still pale and dizzy under a slight relapse of his malady and now a telegram from van helsing whoever he may be you will be grieved to hear that mrs westenra died five days ago and that lucy died the day before yesterday they were both buried to day oh what a wealth of sorrow in a few words poor mrs westenra poor lucy gone gone never to return to us and poor poor arthur to have lost such sweetness out of his life god help us all to bear our troubles dr seward s diary september it is all over arthur has gone back to ring and has taken quincey morris with him what a fine fellow is quincey i believe in my heart of hearts that he suffered as much about lucy s death as any of us but he bore himself through it like a moral viking if america can go on breeding men like that she will be a power in the world indeed van helsing is lying down having a rest preparatory to his journey he goes over to amsterdam to night but says he returns to morrow night that he only wants to make some arrangements which can only be made personally he is to stop with me then if he can he says he has work to do in london which may take him some time poor old fellow i fear that the strain of the past week has broken down even his iron strength all the time of the burial he was i could see putting some terrible restraint on himself when it was all over we were standing beside arthur who poor fellow was speaking of his part in the operation where his blood had been transfused to his lucy s veins i could see van helsing s face grow white and purple by turns arthur was saying that he felt since then as if they two had been really married and that she was his wife in the sight of god none of us said a word of the other operations and none of us ever shall arthur and quincey went away together to the station and van helsing and i came on here the moment we were alone in the carriage he gave way to a regular fit of hysterics he has denied to me since that it was hysterics and insisted that it was only his sense of humour asserting itself under very terrible conditions he laughed till he cried and i had to draw down the blinds lest any one should see us and misjudge and then he cried till he laughed again and laughed and cried together just as a woman does i tried to be stern with him as one is to a woman under the circumstances but it had no effect men and women are so different in manifestations of nervous strength or weakness then when his face grew grave and stern again i asked him why his mirth and why at such a time his reply was in a way characteristic of him for it was logical and forceful and mysterious he said ah you don t comprehend friend john do not think that i am not sad though i laugh see i have cried even when the laugh did choke me but no more think that i am all sorry when i cry for the laugh he come just the same keep it always with you that laughter who knock at your door and say may i come in is not the true laughter no he is a king and he come when and how he like he ask no person he choose no time of suitability he say i am here behold in example i grieve my heart out for that so sweet young girl i give my blood for her though i am old and worn i give my time my skill my sleep i let my other sufferers want that so she may have all and yet i can laugh at her very grave laugh when the clay from the spade of the sexton drop upon her coffin and say thud thud to my heart till it send back the blood from my cheek my heart bleed for that poor boy that dear boy so of the age of mine own boy had i been so blessed that he live and with his hair and eyes the same there you know now why i love him so and yet when he say things that touch my husband heart to the quick and make my father heart yearn to him as to no other man not even to you friend john for we are more level in experiences than father and son yet even at such moment king laugh he come to me and shout and bellow in my ear here i am here i am till the blood come dance back and bring some of the sunshine that he carry with him to my cheek oh friend john it is a strange world a sad world a world full of miseries and woes and troubles and yet when king laugh come he make them all dance to the tune he play bleeding hearts and dry bones of the churchyard and tears that burn as they fall all dance together to the music that he make with that smileless mouth of him and believe me friend john that he is good to come and kind ah we men and women are like ropes drawn tight with strain that pull us different ways then tears come and like the rain on the ropes they brace us up until perhaps the strain become too great and we break but king laugh he come like the sunshine and he ease off the strain again and we bear to go on with our labour what it may be i did not like to wound him by pretending not to see his idea but as i did not yet understand the cause of his laughter i asked him as he answered me his face grew stern and he said in quite a different tone oh it was the grim irony of it all this so lovely lady garlanded with flowers that looked so fair as life till one by one we wondered if she were truly dead she laid in that so fine marble house in that lonely churchyard where rest so many of her kin laid there with the mother who loved her and whom she loved and that sacred bell going toll toll toll so sad and slow and those holy men with the white garments of the angel pretending to read books and yet all the time their eyes never on the page and all of us with the bowed head and all for what she is dead so is it not well for the life of me professor i said i can t see anything to laugh at in all that why your explanation makes it a harder puzzle than before but even if the burial service was comic what about poor art and his trouble why his heart was simply breaking just so said he not that the transfusion of his blood to her veins had made her truly his bride yes and it was a sweet and comforting idea for him quite so but there was a difficulty friend john if so that then what about the others ho ho then this so sweet maid is a polyandrist and me with my poor wife dead to me but alive by church s law though no wits all gone even i who am faithful husband to this now no wife am bigamist i don t see where the joke comes in there either i said and i did not feel particularly pleased with him for saying such things he laid his hand on my arm and said friend john forgive me if i pain i showed not my feeling to others when it would wound but only to you my old friend whom i can trust if you could have looked into my very heart then when i want to laugh if you could have done so when the laugh arrived if you could do so now when king laugh have pack up his crown and all that is to him for he go far far away from me and for a long long time maybe you would perhaps pity me the most of all i was touched by the tenderness of his tone and asked why because i know and now we are all scattered and for many a long day loneliness will sit over our roofs with brooding wings lucy lies in the tomb of her kin a lordly death house in a lonely churchyard away from teeming london where the air is fresh and the sun rises over hampstead hill and where wild flowers grow of their own accord so i can finish this diary and god only knows if i shall ever begin another if i do or if i even open this again it will be to deal with different people and different themes for here at the end where the romance of my life is told ere i go back to take up the thread of my life work i say sadly and without hope finis the westminster gazette september a hampstead mystery the neighbourhood of hampstead is just at present exercised with a series of events which seem to run on lines parallel to those of what was known to the writers of headlines as the kensington horror or the stabbing woman or the woman in black during the past two or three days several cases have occurred of young children straying from home or neglecting to return from their playing on the heath in all these cases the children were too young to give any properly intelligible account of themselves but the consensus of their excuses is that they had been with a bloofer lady it has always been late in the evening when they have been missed and on two occasions the children have not been found until early in the following morning it is generally supposed in the neighbourhood that as the first child missed gave as his reason for being away that a bloofer lady had asked him to come for a walk the others had picked up the phrase and used it as occasion served this is the more natural as the favourite game of the little ones at present is luring each other away by wiles a correspondent writes us that to see some of the tiny tots pretending to be the bloofer lady is supremely funny some of our caricaturists might he says take a lesson in the irony of grotesque by comparing the reality and the picture it is only in accordance with general principles of human nature that the bloofer lady should be the popular r le at these al fresco performances our correspondent na vely says that even ellen terry could not be so winningly attractive as some of these grubby faced little children pretend and even imagine themselves to be there is however possibly a serious side to the question for some of the children indeed all who have been missed at night have been slightly torn or wounded in the throat the wounds seem such as might be made by a rat or a small dog and although of not much importance individually would tend to show that whatever animal inflicts them has a system or method of its own the police of the division have been instructed to keep a sharp look out for straying children especially when very young in and around hampstead heath and for any stray dog which may be about the westminster gazette september extra special the hampstead horror another child injured the bloofer lady we have just received intelligence that another child missed last night was only discovered late in the morning under a furze bush at the shooter s hill side of hampstead heath which is perhaps less frequented than the other parts it has the same tiny wound in the throat as has been noticed in other cases it was terribly weak and looked quite emaciated it too when partially restored had the common story to tell of being lured away by the bloofer lady chapter xiv mina harker s journal september jonathan is better after a bad night i am so glad that he has plenty of work to do for that keeps his mind off the terrible things and oh i am rejoiced that he is not now weighed down with the responsibility of his new position i knew he would be true to himself and now how proud i am to see my jonathan rising to the height of his advancement and keeping pace in all ways with the duties that come upon him he will be away all day till late for he said he could not lunch at home my household work is done so i shall take his foreign journal and lock myself up in my room and read it september i hadn t the heart to write last night that terrible record of jonathan s upset me so poor dear how he must have suffered whether it be true or only imagination i wonder if there is any truth in it at all did he get his brain fever and then write all those terrible things or had he some cause for it all i suppose i shall never know for i dare not open the subject to him and yet that man we saw yesterday he seemed quite certain of him poor fellow i suppose it was the funeral upset him and sent his mind back on some train of thought he believes it all himself i remember how on our wedding day he said unless some solemn duty come upon me to go back to the bitter hours asleep or awake mad or sane there seems to be through it all some thread of continuity that fearful count was coming to london if it should be and he came to london with his teeming millions there may be a solemn duty and if it come we must not shrink from it i shall be prepared i shall get my typewriter this very hour and begin transcribing then we shall be ready for other eyes if required and if it be wanted then perhaps if i am ready poor jonathan may not be upset for i can speak for him and never let him be troubled or worried with it at all if ever jonathan quite gets over the nervousness he may want to tell me of it all and i can ask him questions and find out things and see how i may comfort him letter van helsing to mrs harker september confidence dear madam i pray you to pardon my writing in that i am so far friend as that i sent to you sad news of miss lucy westenra s death by the kindness of lord godalming i am empowered to read her letters and papers for i am deeply concerned about certain matters vitally important in them i find some letters from you which show how great friends you were and how you love her oh madam mina by that love i implore you help me it is for others good that i ask to redress great wrong and to lift much and terrible troubles that may be more great than you can know may it be that i see you you can trust me i am friend of dr john seward and of lord godalming that was arthur of miss lucy i must keep it private for the present from all i should come to exeter to see you at once if you tell me i am privilege to come and where and when i implore your pardon madam i have read your letters to poor lucy and know how good you are and how your husband suffer so i pray you if it may be enlighten him not lest it may harm again your pardon and forgive me van helsing telegram mrs harker to van helsing september come to day by quarter past ten train if you can catch it can see you any time you call wilhelmina harker mina harker s journal september i cannot help feeling terribly excited as the time draws near for the visit of dr van helsing for somehow i expect that it will throw some light upon jonathan s sad experience and as he attended poor dear lucy in her last illness he can tell me all about her that is the reason of his coming it is concerning lucy and her sleep walking and not about jonathan then i shall never know the real truth now how silly i am that awful journal gets hold of my imagination and tinges everything with something of its own colour of course it is about lucy that habit came back to the poor dear and that awful night on the cliff must have made her ill i had almost forgotten in my own affairs how ill she was afterwards she must have told him of her sleep walking adventure on the cliff and that i knew all about it and now he wants me to tell him what she knows so that he may understand i hope i did right in not saying anything of it to mrs westenra i should never forgive myself if any act of mine were it even a negative one brought harm on poor dear lucy i hope too dr van helsing will not blame me i have had so much trouble and anxiety of late that i feel i cannot bear more just at present i suppose a cry does us all good at times clears the air as other rain does perhaps it was reading the journal yesterday that upset me and then jonathan went away this morning to stay away from me a whole day and night the first time we have been parted since our marriage i do hope the dear fellow will take care of himself and that nothing will occur to upset him it is two o clock and the doctor will be here soon now i shall say nothing of jonathan s journal unless he asks me i am so glad i have type written out my own journal so that in case he asks about lucy i can hand it to him it will save much questioning later he has come and gone oh what a strange meeting and how it all makes my head whirl round i feel like one in a dream can it be all possible or even a part of it if i had not read jonathan s journal first i should never have accepted even a possibility poor poor dear jonathan how he must have suffered please the good god all this may not upset him again i shall try to save him from it but it may be even a consolation and a help to him terrible though it be and awful in its consequences to know for certain that his eyes and ears and brain did not deceive him and that it is all true it may be that it is the doubt which haunts him that when the doubt is removed no matter which waking or dreaming may prove the truth he will be more satisfied and better able to bear the shock dr van helsing must be a good man as well as a clever one if he is arthur s friend and dr seward s and if they brought him all the way from holland to look after lucy i feel from having seen him that he is good and kind and of a noble nature when he comes to morrow i shall ask him about jonathan and then please god all this sorrow and anxiety may lead to a good end i used to think i would like to practise interviewing jonathan s friend on the exeter news told him that memory was everything in such work that you must be able to put down exactly almost every word spoken even if you had to refine some of it afterwards here was a rare interview i shall try to record it verbatim it was half past two o clock when the knock came i took my courage deux mains and waited in a few minutes mary opened the door and announced dr van helsing i rose and bowed and he came towards me a man of medium weight strongly built with his shoulders set back over a broad deep chest and a neck well balanced on the trunk as the head is on the neck the poise of the head strikes one at once as indicative of thought and power the head is noble well sized broad and large behind the ears the face clean shaven shows a hard square chin a large resolute mobile mouth a good sized nose rather straight but with quick sensitive nostrils that seem to broaden as the big bushy brows come down and the mouth tightens the forehead is broad and fine rising at first almost straight and then sloping back above two bumps or ridges wide apart such a forehead that the reddish hair cannot possibly tumble over it but falls naturally back and to the sides big dark blue eyes are set widely apart and are quick and tender or stern with the man s moods he said to me mrs harker is it not i bowed assent that was miss mina murray again i assented it is mina murray that i came to see that was friend of that poor dear child lucy westenra madam mina it is on account of the dead i come sir i said you could have no better claim on me than that you were a friend and helper of lucy westenra and i held out my hand he took it and said tenderly oh madam mina i knew that the friend of that poor lily girl must be good but i had yet to learn he finished his speech with a courtly bow i asked him what it was that he wanted to see me about so he at once began i have read your letters to miss lucy forgive me but i had to begin to inquire somewhere and there was none to ask i know that you were with her at whitby she sometimes kept a diary you need not look surprised madam mina it was begun after you had left and was in imitation of you and in that diary she traces by inference certain things to a sleep walking in which she puts down that you saved her in great perplexity then i come to you and ask you out of your so much kindness to tell me all of it that you can remember i can tell you i think dr van helsing all about it ah then you have good memory for facts for details it is not always so with young ladies no doctor but i wrote it all down at the time i can show it to you if you like oh madam mina i will be grateful you will do me much favour i could not resist the temptation of mystifying him a bit i suppose it is some of the taste of the original apple that remains still in our mouths so i handed him the shorthand diary he took it with a grateful bow and said may i read it if you wish i answered as demurely as i could he opened it and for an instant his face fell then he stood up and bowed oh you so clever woman he said i knew long that mr jonathan was a man of much thankfulness but see his wife have all the good things and will you not so much honour me and so help me as to read it for me alas i know not the shorthand by this time my little joke was over and i was almost ashamed so i took the typewritten copy from my workbasket and handed it to him forgive me i said i could not help it but i had been thinking that it was of dear lucy that you wished to ask and so that you might not have time to wait not on my account but because i know your time must be precious i have written it out on the typewriter for you he took it and his eyes glistened you are so good he said and may i read it now i may want to ask you some things when i have read by all means i said read it over whilst i order lunch and then you can ask me questions whilst we eat he bowed and settled himself in a chair with his back to the light and became absorbed in the papers whilst i went to see after lunch chiefly in order that he might not be disturbed when i came back i found him walking hurriedly up and down the room his face all ablaze with excitement he rushed up to me and took me by both hands oh madam mina he said how can i say what i owe to you this paper is as sunshine it opens the gate to me i am daze i am dazzle with so much light and yet clouds roll in behind the light every time but that you do not cannot comprehend oh but i am grateful to you you so clever woman madam he said this very solemnly if ever abraham van helsing can do anything for you or yours i trust you will let me know it will be pleasure and delight if i may serve you as a friend as a friend but all i have ever learned all i can ever do shall be for you and those you love there are darknesses in life and there are lights you are one of the lights you will have happy life and good life and your husband will be blessed in you but doctor you praise me too much and and you do not know me not know you i who am old and who have studied all my life men and women i who have made my specialty the brain and all that belongs to him and all that follow from him and i have read your diary that you have so goodly written for me and which breathes out truth in every line i who have read your so sweet letter to poor lucy of your marriage and your trust not know you oh madam mina good women tell all their lives and by day and by hour and by minute such things that angels can read and we men who wish to know have in us something of angels eyes your husband is noble nature and you are noble too for you trust and trust cannot be where there is mean nature and your husband tell me of him is he quite well is all that fever gone and is he strong and hearty i saw here an opening to ask him about jonathan so i said he was almost recovered but he has been greatly upset by mr hawkins s death he interrupted oh yes i know i know i have read your last two letters i went on i suppose this upset him for when we were in town on thursday last he had a sort of shock a shock and after brain fever so soon that was not good what kind of a shock was it he thought he saw some one who recalled something terrible something which led to his brain fever and here the whole thing seemed to overwhelm me in a rush the pity for jonathan the horror which he experienced the whole fearful mystery of his diary and the fear that has been brooding over me ever since all came in a tumult i suppose i was hysterical for i threw myself on my knees and held up my hands to him and implored him to make my husband well again he took my hands and raised me up and made me sit on the sofa and sat by me he held my hand in his and said to me with oh such infinite sweetness my life is a barren and lonely one and so full of work that i have not had much time for friendships but since i have been summoned to here by my friend john seward i have known so many good people and seen such nobility that i feel more than ever and it has grown with my advancing years the loneliness of my life believe me then that i come here full of respect for you and you have given me hope hope not in what i am seeking of but that there are good women still left to make life happy good women whose lives and whose truths may make good lesson for the children that are to be i am glad glad that i may here be of some use to you for if your husband suffer he suffer within the range of my study and experience i promise you that i will gladly do all for him that i can all to make his life strong and manly and your life a happy one now you must eat you are overwrought and perhaps over anxious husband jonathan would not like to see you so pale and what he like not where he love is not to his good therefore for his sake you must eat and smile you have told me all about lucy and so now we shall not speak of it lest it distress i shall stay in exeter to night for i want to think much over what you have told me and when i have thought i will ask you questions if i may and then too you will tell me of husband jonathan s trouble so far as you can but not yet you must eat now afterwards you shall tell me all after lunch when we went back to the drawing room he said to me and now tell me all about him when it came to speaking to this great learned man i began to fear that he would think me a weak fool and jonathan a madman that journal is all so strange and i hesitated to go on but he was so sweet and kind and he had promised to help and i trusted him so i said dr van helsing what i have to tell you is so queer that you must not laugh at me or at my husband i have been since yesterday in a sort of fever of doubt you must be kind to me and not think me foolish that i have even half believed some very strange things he reassured me by his manner as well as his words when he said oh my dear if you only know how strange is the matter regarding which i am here it is you who would laugh i have learned not to think little of any one s belief no matter how strange it be i have tried to keep an open mind and it is not the ordinary things of life that could close it but the strange things the extraordinary things the things that make one doubt if they be mad or sane thank you thank you a thousand times you have taken a weight off my mind if you will let me i shall give you a paper to read it is long but i have typewritten it out it will tell you my trouble and jonathan s it is the copy of his journal when abroad and all that happened i dare not say anything of it you will read for yourself and judge and then when i see you perhaps you will be very kind and tell me what you think i promise he said as i gave him the papers i shall in the morning so soon as i can come to see you and your husband if i may jonathan will be here at half past eleven and you must come to lunch with us and see him then you could catch the quick train which will leave you at paddington before eight he was surprised at my knowledge of the trains off hand but he does not know that i have made up all the trains to and from exeter so that i may help jonathan in case he is in a hurry so he took the papers with him and went away and i sit here thinking thinking i don t know what letter by hand van helsing to mrs harker september o clock dear madam mina i have read your husband s so wonderful diary you may sleep without doubt strange and terrible as it is it is true i will pledge my life on it it may be worse for others but for him and you there is no dread he is a noble fellow and let me tell you from experience of men that one who would do as he did in going down that wall and to that room ay and going a second time is not one to be injured in permanence by a shock his brain and his heart are all right this i swear before i have even seen him so be at rest i shall have much to ask him of other things i am blessed that to day i come to see you for i have learn all at once so much that again i am dazzle dazzle more than ever and i must think yours the most faithful abraham van helsing letter mrs harker to van helsing september p m my dear dr van helsing a thousand thanks for your kind letter which has taken a great weight off my mind and yet if it be true what terrible things there are in the world and what an awful thing if that man that monster be really in london i fear to think i have this moment whilst writing had a wire from jonathan saying that he leaves by the to night from launceston and will be here at so that i shall have no fear to night will you therefore instead of lunching with us please come to breakfast at eight o clock if this be not too early for you you can get away if you are in a hurry by the train which will bring you to paddington by do not answer this as i shall take it that if i do not hear you will come to breakfast believe me your faithful and grateful friend mina harker jonathan harker s journal september i thought never to write in this diary again but the time has come when i got home last night mina had supper ready and when we had supped she told me of van helsing s visit and of her having given him the two diaries copied out and of how anxious she has been about me she showed me in the doctor s letter that all i wrote down was true it seems to have made a new man of me it was the doubt as to the reality of the whole thing that knocked me over i felt impotent and in the dark and distrustful but now that i know i am not afraid even of the count he has succeeded after all then in his design in getting to london and it was he i saw he has got younger and how van helsing is the man to unmask him and hunt him out if he is anything like what mina says we sat late and talked it all over mina is dressing and i shall call at the hotel in a few minutes and bring him over he was i think surprised to see me when i came into the room where he was and introduced myself he took me by the shoulder and turned my face round to the light and said after a sharp scrutiny but madam mina told me you were ill that you had had a shock it was so funny to hear my wife called madam mina by this kindly strong faced old man i smiled and said i was ill i have had a shock but you have cured me already and how by your letter to mina last night i was in doubt and then everything took a hue of unreality and i did not know what to trust even the evidence of my own senses not knowing what to trust i did not know what to do and so had only to keep on working in what had hitherto been the groove of my life the groove ceased to avail me and i mistrusted myself doctor you don t know what it is to doubt everything even yourself no you don t you couldn t with eyebrows like yours he seemed pleased and laughed as he said so you are physiognomist i learn more here with each hour i am with so much pleasure coming to you to breakfast and oh sir you will pardon praise from an old man but you are blessed in your wife i would listen to him go on praising mina for a day so i simply nodded and stood silent she is one of god s women fashioned by his own hand to show us men and other women that there is a heaven where we can enter and that its light can be here on earth so true so sweet so noble so little an egoist and that let me tell you is much in this age so sceptical and selfish and you sir i have read all the letters to poor miss lucy and some of them speak of you so i know you since some days from the knowing of others but i have seen your true self since last night you will give me your hand will you not and let us be friends for all our lives we shook hands and he was so earnest and so kind that it made me quite choky and now he said may i ask you for some more help i have a great task to do and at the beginning it is to know you can help me here can you tell me what went before your going to transylvania later on i may ask more help and of a different kind but at first this will do look here sir i said does what you have to do concern the count it does he said solemnly then i am with you heart and soul as you go by the train you will not have time to read them but i shall get the bundle of papers you can take them with you and read them in the train after breakfast i saw him to the station when we were parting he said perhaps you will come to town if i send to you and take madam mina too we shall both come when you will i said i had got him the morning papers and the london papers of the previous night and while we were talking at the carriage window waiting for the train to start he was turning them over his eyes suddenly seemed to catch something in one of them the westminster gazette i knew it by the colour and he grew quite white he read something intently groaning to himself mein gott mein gott so soon so soon i do not think he remembered me at the moment just then the whistle blew and the train moved off this recalled him to himself and he leaned out of the window and waved his hand calling out love to madam mina i shall write so soon as ever i can dr seward s diary september truly there is no such thing as finality not a week since i said finis and yet here i am starting fresh again or rather going on with the same record until this afternoon i had no cause to think of what is done renfield had become to all intents as sane as he ever was he was already well ahead with his fly business and he had just started in the spider line also so he had not been of any trouble to me i had a letter from arthur written on sunday and from it i gather that he is bearing up wonderfully well quincey morris is with him and that is much of a help for he himself is a bubbling well of good spirits quincey wrote me a line too and from him i hear that arthur is beginning to recover something of his old buoyancy so as to them all my mind is at rest as for myself i was settling down to my work with the enthusiasm which i used to have for it so that i might fairly have said that the wound which poor lucy left on me was becoming cicatrised everything is however now reopened and what is to be the end god only knows i have an idea that van helsing thinks he knows too but he will only let out enough at a time to whet curiosity he went to exeter yesterday and stayed there all night to day he came back and almost bounded into the room at about half past five o clock and thrust last night s westminster gazette into my hand what do you think of that he asked as he stood back and folded his arms i looked over the paper for i really did not know what he meant but he took it from me and pointed out a paragraph about children being decoyed away at hampstead it did not convey much to me until i reached a passage where it described small punctured wounds on their throats an idea struck me and i looked up well he said it is like poor lucy s and what do you make of it simply that there is some cause in common whatever it was that injured her has injured them i did not quite understand his answer that is true indirectly but not directly how do you mean professor i asked i was a little inclined to take his seriousness lightly for after all four days of rest and freedom from burning harrowing anxiety does help to restore one s spirits but when i saw his face it sobered me never even in the midst of our despair about poor lucy had he looked more stern tell me i said i can hazard no opinion i do not know what to think and i have no data on which to found a conjecture do you mean to tell me friend john that you have no suspicion as to what poor lucy died of not after all the hints given not only by events but by me of nervous prostration following on great loss or waste of blood and how the blood lost or waste i shook my head he stepped over and sat down beside me and went on you are clever man friend john you reason well and your wit is bold but you are too prejudiced you do not let your eyes see nor your ears hear and that which is outside your daily life is not of account to you do you not think that there are things which you cannot understand and yet which are that some people see things that others cannot but there are things old and new which must not be contemplate by men s eyes because they know or think they know some things which other men have told them ah it is the fault of our science that it wants to explain all and if it explain not then it says there is nothing to explain but yet we see around us every day the growth of new beliefs which think themselves new and which are yet but the old which pretend to be young like the fine ladies at the opera i suppose now you do not believe in corporeal transference no nor in materialisation no nor in astral bodies no nor in the reading of thought no nor in hypnotism yes i said charcot has proved that pretty well he smiled as he went on then you are satisfied as to it yes and of course then you understand how it act and can follow the mind of the great charcot alas that he is no more into the very soul of the patient that he influence no then friend john am i to take it that you simply accept fact and are satisfied to let from premise to conclusion be a blank no then tell me for i am student of the brain how you accept the hypnotism and reject the thought reading let me tell you my friend that there are things done to day in electrical science which would have been deemed unholy by the very men who discovered electricity who would themselves not so long before have been burned as wizards there are always mysteries in life why was it that methuselah lived nine hundred years and old parr one hundred and sixty nine and yet that poor lucy with four men s blood in her poor veins could not live even one day for had she live one more day we could have save her do you know all the mystery of life and death do you know the altogether of comparative anatomy and can say wherefore the qualities of brutes are in some men and not in others can you tell me why when other spiders die small and soon that one great spider lived for centuries in the tower of the old spanish church and grew and grew till on descending he could drink the oil of all the church lamps can you tell me why in the pampas ay and elsewhere there are bats that come at night and open the veins of cattle and horses and suck dry their veins how in some islands of the western seas there are bats which hang on the trees all day and those who have seen describe as like giant nuts or pods and that when the sailors sleep on the deck because that it is hot flit down on them and then and then in the morning are found dead men white as even miss lucy was good god professor i said starting up do you mean to tell me that lucy was bitten by such a bat and that such a thing is here in london in the nineteenth century he waved his hand for silence and went on can you tell me why the tortoise lives more long than generations of men why the elephant goes on and on till he have seen dynasties and why the parrot never die only of bite of cat or dog or other complaint can you tell me why men believe in all ages and places that there are some few who live on always if they be permit that there are men and women who cannot die we all know because science has vouched for the fact that there have been toads shut up in rocks for thousands of years shut in one so small hole that only hold him since the youth of the world can you tell me how the indian fakir can make himself to die and have been buried and his grave sealed and corn sowed on it and the corn reaped and be cut and sown and reaped and cut again and then men come and take away the unbroken seal and that there lie the indian fakir not dead but that rise up and walk amongst them as before here i interrupted him i was getting bewildered he so crowded on my mind his list of nature s eccentricities and possible impossibilities that my imagination was getting fired i had a dim idea that he was teaching me some lesson as long ago he used to do in his study at amsterdam but he used then to tell me the thing so that i could have the object of thought in mind all the time but now i was without this help yet i wanted to follow him so i said professor let me be your pet student again tell me the thesis so that i may apply your knowledge as you go on at present i am going in my mind from point to point as a mad man and not a sane one follows an idea i feel like a novice lumbering through a bog in a mist jumping from one tussock to another in the mere blind effort to move on without knowing where i am going that is good image he said well i shall tell you my thesis is this i want you to believe to believe what to believe in things that you cannot let me illustrate i heard once of an american who so defined faith that faculty which enables us to believe things which we know to be untrue for one i follow that man he meant that we shall have an open mind and not let a little bit of truth check the rush of a big truth like a small rock does a railway truck we get the small truth first good we keep him and we value him but all the same we must not let him think himself all the truth in the universe then you want me not to let some previous conviction injure the receptivity of my mind with regard to some strange matter do i read your lesson aright ah you are my favourite pupil still it is worth to teach you now that you are willing to understand you have taken the first step to understand you think then that those so small holes in the children s throats were made by the same that made the hole in miss lucy i suppose so he stood up and said solemnly then you are wrong oh would it were so but alas no it is worse far far worse in god s name professor van helsing what do you mean i cried he threw himself with a despairing gesture into a chair and placed his elbows on the table covering his face with his hands as he spoke they were made by miss lucy chapter xv dr seward s diary continued for a while sheer anger mastered me it was as if he had during her life struck lucy on the face i smote the table hard and rose up as i said to him dr van helsing are you mad he raised his head and looked at me and somehow the tenderness of his face calmed me at once would i were he said madness were easy to bear compared with truth like this oh my friend why think you did i go so far round why take so long to tell you so simple a thing was it because i hate you and have hated you all my life was it because i wished to give you pain was it that i wanted now so late revenge for that time when you saved my life and from a fearful death ah no forgive me said i he went on my friend it was because i wished to be gentle in the breaking to you for i know you have loved that so sweet lady but even yet i do not expect you to believe it is so hard to accept at once any abstract truth that we may doubt such to be possible when we have always believed the no of it it is more hard still to accept so sad a concrete truth and of such a one as miss lucy to night i go to prove it dare you come with me this staggered me a man does not like to prove such a truth byron excepted from the category jealousy and prove the very truth he most abhorred he saw my hesitation and spoke the logic is simple no madman s logic this time jumping from tussock to tussock in a misty bog if it be not true then proof will be relief at worst it will not harm if it be true ah there is the dread yet very dread should help my cause for in it is some need of belief come i tell you what i propose first that we go off now and see that child in the hospital dr vincent of the north hospital where the papers say the child is is friend of mine and i think of yours since you were in class at amsterdam he will let two scientists see his case if he will not let two friends we shall tell him nothing but only that we wish to learn and then and then he took a key from his pocket and held it up and then we spend the night you and i in the churchyard where lucy lies this is the key that lock the tomb i had it from the coffin man to give to arthur my heart sank within me for i felt that there was some fearful ordeal before us i could do nothing however so i plucked up what heart i could and said that we had better hasten as the afternoon was passing we found the child awake it had had a sleep and taken some food and altogether was going on well dr vincent took the bandage from its throat and showed us the punctures there was no mistaking the similarity to those which had been on lucy s throat they were smaller and the edges looked fresher that was all we asked vincent to what he attributed them and he replied that it must have been a bite of some animal perhaps a rat but for his own part he was inclined to think that it was one of the bats which are so numerous on the northern heights of london out of so many harmless ones he said there may be some wild specimen from the south of a more malignant species some sailor may have brought one home and it managed to escape or even from the zo logical gardens a young one may have got loose or one be bred there from a vampire these things do occur you know only ten days ago a wolf got out and was i believe traced up in this direction for a week after the children were playing nothing but red riding hood on the heath and in every alley in the place until this bloofer lady scare came along since when it has been quite a gala time with them even this poor little mite when he woke up to day asked the nurse if he might go away when she asked him why he wanted to go he said he wanted to play with the bloofer lady i hope said van helsing that when you are sending the child home you will caution its parents to keep strict watch over it these fancies to stray are most dangerous and if the child were to remain out another night it would probably be fatal but in any case i suppose you will not let it away for some days certainly not not for a week at least longer if the wound is not healed our visit to the hospital took more time than we had reckoned on and the sun had dipped before we came out when van helsing saw how dark it was he said there is no hurry it is more late than i thought come let us seek somewhere that we may eat and then we shall go on our way we dined at jack straw s castle along with a little crowd of bicyclists and others who were genially noisy about ten o clock we started from the inn it was then very dark and the scattered lamps made the darkness greater when we were once outside their individual radius the professor had evidently noted the road we were to go for he went on unhesitatingly but as for me i was in quite a mixup as to locality as we went further we met fewer and fewer people till at last we were somewhat surprised when we met even the patrol of horse police going their usual suburban round at last we reached the wall of the churchyard which we climbed over with some little difficulty for it was very dark and the whole place seemed so strange to us we found the westenra tomb the professor took the key opened the creaky door and standing back politely but quite unconsciously motioned me to precede him there was a delicious irony in the offer in the courtliness of giving preference on such a ghastly occasion my companion followed me quickly and cautiously drew the door to after carefully ascertaining that the lock was a falling and not a spring one in the latter case we should have been in a bad plight then he fumbled in his bag and taking out a matchbox and a piece of candle proceeded to make a light the tomb in the day time and when wreathed with fresh flowers had looked grim and gruesome enough but now some days afterwards when the flowers hung lank and dead their whites turning to rust and their greens to browns when the spider and the beetle had resumed their accustomed dominance when time discoloured stone and dust encrusted mortar and rusty dank iron and tarnished brass and clouded silver plating gave back the feeble glimmer of a candle the effect was more miserable and sordid than could have been imagined it conveyed irresistibly the idea that life animal life was not the only thing which could pass away van helsing went about his work systematically holding his candle so that he could read the coffin plates and so holding it that the sperm dropped in white patches which congealed as they touched the metal he made assurance of lucy s coffin another search in his bag and he took out a turnscrew what are you going to do i asked to open the coffin you shall yet be convinced straightway he began taking out the screws and finally lifted off the lid showing the casing of lead beneath the sight was almost too much for me it seemed to be as much an affront to the dead as it would have been to have stripped off her clothing in her sleep whilst living i actually took hold of his hand to stop him he only said you shall see and again fumbling in his bag took out a tiny fret saw striking the turnscrew through the lead with a swift downward stab which made me wince he made a small hole which was however big enough to admit the point of the saw i had expected a rush of gas from the week old corpse we doctors who have had to study our dangers have to become accustomed to such things and i drew back towards the door but the professor never stopped for a moment he sawed down a couple of feet along one side of the lead coffin and then across and down the other side taking the edge of the loose flange he bent it back towards the foot of the coffin and holding up the candle into the aperture motioned to me to look i drew near and looked the coffin was empty it was certainly a surprise to me and gave me a considerable shock but van helsing was unmoved he was now more sure than ever of his ground and so emboldened to proceed in his task are you satisfied now friend john he asked i felt all the dogged argumentativeness of my nature awake within me as i answered him i am satisfied that lucy s body is not in that coffin but that only proves one thing and what is that friend john that it is not there that is good logic he said so far as it goes but how do you how can you account for it not being there perhaps a body snatcher i suggested some of the undertaker s people may have stolen it i felt that i was speaking folly and yet it was the only real cause which i could suggest the professor sighed ah well he said we must have more proof come with me he put on the coffin lid again gathered up all his things and placed them in the bag blew out the light and placed the candle also in the bag we opened the door and went out behind us he closed the door and locked it he handed me the key saying will you keep it you had better be assured i laughed it was not a very cheerful laugh i am bound to say as i motioned him to keep it a key is nothing i said there may be duplicates and anyhow it is not difficult to pick a lock of that kind he said nothing but put the key in his pocket then he told me to watch at one side of the churchyard whilst he would watch at the other i took up my place behind a yew tree and i saw his dark figure move until the intervening headstones and trees hid it from my sight it was a lonely vigil just after i had taken my place i heard a distant clock strike twelve and in time came one and two i was chilled and unnerved and angry with the professor for taking me on such an errand and with myself for coming i was too cold and too sleepy to be keenly observant and not sleepy enough to betray my trust so altogether i had a dreary miserable time suddenly as i turned round i thought i saw something like a white streak moving between two dark yew trees at the side of the churchyard farthest from the tomb at the same time a dark mass moved from the professor s side of the ground and hurriedly went towards it then i too moved but i had to go round headstones and railed off tombs and i stumbled over graves the sky was overcast and somewhere far off an early cock crew a little way off beyond a line of scattered juniper trees which marked the pathway to the church a white dim figure flitted in the direction of the tomb the tomb itself was hidden by trees and i could not see where the figure disappeared i heard the rustle of actual movement where i had first seen the white figure and coming over found the professor holding in his arms a tiny child when he saw me he held it out to me and said are you satisfied now no i said in a way that i felt was aggressive do you not see the child yes it is a child but who brought it here and is it wounded i asked we shall see said the professor and with one impulse we took our way out of the churchyard he carrying the sleeping child when we had got some little distance away we went into a clump of trees and struck a match and looked at the child s throat it was without a scratch or scar of any kind was i right i asked triumphantly we were just in time said the professor thankfully we had now to decide what we were to do with the child and so consulted about it if we were to take it to a police station we should have to give some account of our movements during the night at least we should have had to make some statement as to how we had come to find the child so finally we decided that we would take it to the heath and when we heard a policeman coming would leave it where he could not fail to find it we would then seek our way home as quickly as we could all fell out well at the edge of hampstead heath we heard a policeman s heavy tramp and laying the child on the pathway we waited and watched until he saw it as he flashed his lantern to and fro we heard his exclamation of astonishment and then we went away silently by good chance we got a cab near the spaniards and drove to town i cannot sleep so i make this entry but i must try to get a few hours sleep as van helsing is to call for me at noon he insists that i shall go with him on another expedition september it was two o clock before we found a suitable opportunity for our attempt the funeral held at noon was all completed and the last stragglers of the mourners had taken themselves lazily away when looking carefully from behind a clump of alder trees we saw the sexton lock the gate after him we knew then that we were safe till morning did we desire it but the professor told me that we should not want more than an hour at most again i felt that horrid sense of the reality of things in which any effort of imagination seemed out of place and i realised distinctly the perils of the law which we were incurring in our unhallowed work besides i felt it was all so useless outrageous as it was to open a leaden coffin to see if a woman dead nearly a week were really dead it now seemed the height of folly to open the tomb again when we knew from the evidence of our own eyesight that the coffin was empty i shrugged my shoulders however and rested silent for van helsing had a way of going on his own road no matter who remonstrated he took the key opened the vault and again courteously motioned me to precede the place was not so gruesome as last night but oh how unutterably mean looking when the sunshine streamed in van helsing walked over to lucy s coffin and i followed he bent over and again forced back the leaden flange and then a shock of surprise and dismay shot through me there lay lucy seemingly just as we had seen her the night before her funeral she was if possible more radiantly beautiful than ever and i could not believe that she was dead the lips were red nay redder than before and on the cheeks was a delicate bloom is this a juggle i said to him are you convinced now said the professor in response and as he spoke he put over his hand and in a way that made me shudder pulled back the dead lips and showed the white teeth see he went on see they are even sharper than before with this and this and he touched one of the canine teeth and that below it the little children can be bitten are you of belief now friend john once more argumentative hostility woke within me i could not accept such an overwhelming idea as he suggested so with an attempt to argue of which i was even at the moment ashamed i said she may have been placed here since last night indeed that is so and by whom i do not know some one has done it and yet she has been dead one week most peoples in that time would not look so i had no answer for this so was silent van helsing did not seem to notice my silence at any rate he showed neither chagrin nor triumph he was looking intently at the face of the dead woman raising the eyelids and looking at the eyes and once more opening the lips and examining the teeth then he turned to me and said here there is one thing which is different from all recorded here is some dual life that is not as the common she was bitten by the vampire when she was in a trance sleep walking oh you start you do not know that friend john but you shall know it all later and in trance could he best come to take more blood in trance she died and in trance she is un dead too so it is that she differ from all other usually when the un dead sleep at home as he spoke he made a comprehensive sweep of his arm to designate what to a vampire was home their face show what they are but this so sweet that was when she not un dead she go back to the nothings of the common dead there is no malign there see and so it make hard that i must kill her in her sleep this turned my blood cold and it began to dawn upon me that i was accepting van helsing s theories but if she were really dead what was there of terror in the idea of killing her he looked up at me and evidently saw the change in my face for he said almost joyously ah you believe now i answered do not press me too hard all at once i am willing to accept how will you do this bloody work i shall cut off her head and fill her mouth with garlic and i shall drive a stake through her body it made me shudder to think of so mutilating the body of the woman whom i had loved and yet the feeling was not so strong as i had expected i was in fact beginning to shudder at the presence of this being this un dead as van helsing called it and to loathe it is it possible that love is all subjective or all objective i waited a considerable time for van helsing to begin but he stood as if wrapped in thought presently he closed the catch of his bag with a snap and said i have been thinking and have made up my mind as to what is best if i did simply follow my inclining i would do now at this moment what is to be done but there are other things to follow and things that are thousand times more difficult in that them we do not know this is simple she have yet no life taken though that is of time and to act now would be to take danger from her for ever but then we may have to want arthur and how shall we tell him of this if you who saw the wounds on lucy s throat and saw the wounds so similar on the child s at the hospital if you who saw the coffin empty last night and full to day with a woman who have not change only to be more rose and more beautiful in a whole week after she die if you know of this and know of the white figure last night that brought the child to the churchyard and yet of your own senses you did not believe how then can i expect arthur who know none of those things to believe he doubted me when i took him from her kiss when she was dying i know he has forgiven me because in some mistaken idea i have done things that prevent him say good bye as he ought and he may think that in some more mistaken idea this woman was buried alive and that in most mistake of all we have killed her he will then argue back that it is we mistaken ones that have killed her by our ideas and so he will be much unhappy always yet he never can be sure and that is the worst of all and he will sometimes think that she he loved was buried alive and that will paint his dreams with horrors of what she must have suffered and again he will think that we may be right and that his so beloved was after all an un dead no i told him once and since then i learn much now since i know it is all true a hundred thousand times more do i know that he must pass through the bitter waters to reach the sweet he poor fellow must have one hour that will make the very face of heaven grow black to him then we can act for good all round and send him peace my mind is made up let us go you return home for to night to your asylum and see that all be well as for me i shall spend the night here in this churchyard in my own way to morrow night you will come to me to the berkeley hotel at ten of the clock i shall send for arthur to come too and also that so fine young man of america that gave his blood later we shall all have work to do i come with you so far as piccadilly and there dine for i must be back here before the sun set so we locked the tomb and came away and got over the wall of the churchyard which was not much of a task and drove back to piccadilly note left by van helsing in his portmanteau berkeley hotel directed to john seward m d not delivered september friend john i write this in case anything should happen i go alone to watch in that churchyard it pleases me that the un dead miss lucy shall not leave to night that so on the morrow night she may be more eager therefore i shall fix some things she like not garlic and a crucifix and so seal up the door of the tomb she is young as un dead and will heed moreover these are only to prevent her coming out they may not prevail on her wanting to get in for then the un dead is desperate and must find the line of least resistance whatsoever it may be i shall be at hand all the night from sunset till after the sunrise and if there be aught that may be learned i shall learn it for miss lucy or from her i have no fear but that other to whom is there that she is un dead he have now the power to seek her tomb and find shelter he is cunning as i know from mr jonathan and from the way that all along he have fooled us when he played with us for miss lucy s life and we lost and in many ways the un dead are strong he have always the strength in his hand of twenty men even we four who gave our strength to miss lucy it also is all to him besides he can summon his wolf and i know not what so if it be that he come thither on this night he shall find me but none other shall until it be too late but it may be that he will not attempt the place there is no reason why he should his hunting ground is more full of game than the churchyard where the un dead woman sleep and the one old man watch therefore i write this in case take the papers that are with this the diaries of harker and the rest and read them and then find this great un dead and cut off his head and burn his heart or drive a stake through it so that the world may rest from him if it be so farewell van helsing dr seward s diary september it is wonderful what a good night s sleep will do for one yesterday i was almost willing to accept van helsing s monstrous ideas but now they seem to start out lurid before me as outrages on common sense i have no doubt that he believes it all i wonder if his mind can have become in any way unhinged surely there must be some rational explanation of all these mysterious things is it possible that the professor can have done it himself he is so abnormally clever that if he went off his head he would carry out his intent with regard to some fixed idea in a wonderful way i am loath to think it and indeed it would be almost as great a marvel as the other to find that van helsing was mad but anyhow i shall watch him carefully i may get some light on the mystery september morning last night at a little before ten o clock arthur and quincey came into van helsing s room he told us all that he wanted us to do but especially addressing himself to arthur as if all our wills were centred in his he began by saying that he hoped we would all come with him too for he said there is a grave duty to be done there you were doubtless surprised at my letter this query was directly addressed to lord godalming i was it rather upset me for a bit there has been so much trouble around my house of late that i could do without any more i have been curious too as to what you mean quincey and i talked it over but the more we talked the more puzzled we got till now i can say for myself that i m about up a tree as to any meaning about anything me too said quincey morris laconically oh said the professor then you are nearer the beginning both of you than friend john here who has to go a long way back before he can even get so far as to begin it was evident that he recognised my return to my old doubting frame of mind without my saying a word then turning to the other two he said with intense gravity i want your permission to do what i think good this night it is i know much to ask and when you know what it is i propose to do you will know and only then how much therefore may i ask that you promise me in the dark so that afterwards though you may be angry with me for a time i must not disguise from myself the possibility that such may be you shall not blame yourselves for anything that s frank anyhow broke in quincey i ll answer for the professor i don t quite see his drift but i swear he s honest and that s good enough for me i thank you sir said van helsing proudly i have done myself the honour of counting you one trusting friend and such endorsement is dear to me he held out a hand which quincey took then arthur spoke out dr van helsing i don t quite like to buy a pig in a poke as they say in scotland and if it be anything in which my honour as a gentleman or my faith as a christian is concerned i cannot make such a promise if you can assure me that what you intend does not violate either of these two then i give my consent at once though for the life of me i cannot understand what you are driving at i accept your limitation said van helsing and all i ask of you is that if you feel it necessary to condemn any act of mine you will first consider it well and be satisfied that it does not violate your reservations agreed said arthur that is only fair and now that the pourparlers are over may i ask what it is we are to do i want you to come with me and to come in secret to the churchyard at kingstead arthur s face fell as he said in an amazed sort of way where poor lucy is buried the professor bowed arthur went on and when there to enter the tomb arthur stood up professor are you in earnest or it is some monstrous joke pardon me i see that you are in earnest he sat down again but i could see that he sat firmly and proudly as one who is on his dignity there was silence until he asked again and when in the tomb to open the coffin this is too much he said angrily rising again i am willing to be patient in all things that are reasonable but in this this desecration of the grave of one who he fairly choked with indignation the professor looked pityingly at him if i could spare you one pang my poor friend he said god knows i would but this night our feet must tread in thorny paths or later and for ever the feet you love must walk in paths of flame arthur looked up with set white face and said take care sir take care would it not be well to hear what i have to say said van helsing and then you will at least know the limit of my purpose shall i go on that s fair enough broke in morris after a pause van helsing went on evidently with an effort miss lucy is dead is it not so yes then there can be no wrong to her but if she be not dead arthur jumped to his feet good god he cried what do you mean has there been any mistake has she been buried alive he groaned in anguish that not even hope could soften i did not say she was alive my child i did not think it i go no further than to say that she might be un dead un dead not alive what do you mean is this all a nightmare or what is it there are mysteries which men can only guess at which age by age they may solve only in part believe me we are now on the verge of one but i have not done may i cut off the head of dead miss lucy heavens and earth no cried arthur in a storm of passion not for the wide world will i consent to any mutilation of her dead body dr van helsing you try me too far what have i done to you that you should torture me so what did that poor sweet girl do that you should want to cast such dishonour on her grave are you mad to speak such things or am i mad to listen to them don t dare to think more of such a desecration i shall not give my consent to anything you do i have a duty to do in protecting her grave from outrage and by god i shall do it van helsing rose up from where he had all the time been seated and said gravely and sternly my lord godalming i too have a duty to do a duty to others a duty to you a duty to the dead and by god i shall do it all i ask you now is that you come with me that you look and listen and if when later i make the same request you do not be more eager for its fulfilment even than i am then then i shall do my duty whatever it may seem to me and then to follow of your lordship s wishes i shall hold myself at your disposal to render an account to you when and where you will his voice broke a little and he went on with a voice full of pity but i beseech you do not go forth in anger with me in a long life of acts which were often not pleasant to do and which sometimes did wring my heart i have never had so heavy a task as now believe me that if the time comes for you to change your mind towards me one look from you will wipe away all this so sad hour for i would do what a man can to save you from sorrow just think for why should i give myself so much of labour and so much of sorrow i have come here from my own land to do what i can of good at the first to please my friend john and then to help a sweet young lady whom too i came to love for her i am ashamed to say so much but i say it in kindness i gave what you gave the blood of my veins i gave it i who was not like you her lover but only her physician and her friend i gave to her my nights and days before death after death and if my death can do her good even now when she is the dead un dead she shall have it freely he said this with a very grave sweet pride and arthur was much affected by it he took the old man s hand and said in a broken voice oh it is hard to think of it and i cannot understand but at least i shall go with you and wait chapter xvi dr seward s diary continued it was just a quarter before twelve o clock when we got into the churchyard over the low wall the night was dark with occasional gleams of moonlight between the rents of the heavy clouds that scudded across the sky we all kept somehow close together with van helsing slightly in front as he led the way when we had come close to the tomb i looked well at arthur for i feared that the proximity to a place laden with so sorrowful a memory would upset him but he bore himself well i took it that the very mystery of the proceeding was in some way a counteractant to his grief the professor unlocked the door and seeing a natural hesitation amongst us for various reasons solved the difficulty by entering first himself the rest of us followed and he closed the door he then lit a dark lantern and pointed to the coffin arthur stepped forward hesitatingly van helsing said to me you were with me here yesterday was the body of miss lucy in that coffin it was the professor turned to the rest saying you hear and yet there is no one who does not believe with me he took his screwdriver and again took off the lid of the coffin arthur looked on very pale but silent when the lid was removed he stepped forward he evidently did not know that there was a leaden coffin or at any rate had not thought of it when he saw the rent in the lead the blood rushed to his face for an instant but as quickly fell away again so that he remained of a ghastly whiteness he was still silent van helsing forced back the leaden flange and we all looked in and recoiled the coffin was empty for several minutes no one spoke a word the silence was broken by quincey morris professor i answered for you your word is all i want i wouldn t ask such a thing ordinarily i wouldn t so dishonour you as to imply a doubt but this is a mystery that goes beyond any honour or dishonour is this your doing i swear to you by all that i hold sacred that i have not removed nor touched her what happened was this two nights ago my friend seward and i came here with good purpose believe me i opened that coffin which was then sealed up and we found it as now empty we then waited and saw something white come through the trees the next day we came here in day time and she lay there did she not friend john yes that night we were just in time one more so small child was missing and we find it thank god unharmed amongst the graves yesterday i came here before sundown for at sundown the un dead can move i waited here all the night till the sun rose but i saw nothing it was most probable that it was because i had laid over the clamps of those doors garlic which the un dead cannot bear and other things which they shun last night there was no exodus so to night before the sundown i took away my garlic and other things and so it is we find this coffin empty but bear with me so far there is much that is strange wait you with me outside unseen and unheard and things much stranger are yet to be so here he shut the dark slide of his lantern now to the outside he opened the door and we filed out he coming last and locking the door behind him oh but it seemed fresh and pure in the night air after the terror of that vault how sweet it was to see the clouds race by and the passing gleams of the moonlight between the scudding clouds crossing and passing like the gladness and sorrow of a man s life how sweet it was to breathe the fresh air that had no taint of death and decay how humanising to see the red lighting of the sky beyond the hill and to hear far away the muffled roar that marks the life of a great city each in his own way was solemn and overcome arthur was silent and was i could see striving to grasp the purpose and the inner meaning of the mystery i was myself tolerably patient and half inclined again to throw aside doubt and to accept van helsing s conclusions quincey morris was phlegmatic in the way of a man who accepts all things and accepts them in the spirit of cool bravery with hazard of all he has to stake not being able to smoke he cut himself a good sized plug of tobacco and began to chew as to van helsing he was employed in a definite way first he took from his bag a mass of what looked like thin wafer like biscuit which was carefully rolled up in a white napkin next he took out a double handful of some whitish stuff like dough or putty he crumbled the wafer up fine and worked it into the mass between his hands this he then took and rolling it into thin strips began to lay them into the crevices between the door and its setting in the tomb i was somewhat puzzled at this and being close asked him what it was that he was doing arthur and quincey drew near also as they too were curious he answered i am closing the tomb so that the un dead may not enter and is that stuff you have put there going to do it asked quincey great scott is this a game it is what is that which you are using this time the question was by arthur van helsing reverently lifted his hat as he answered the host i brought it from amsterdam i have an indulgence it was an answer that appalled the most sceptical of us and we felt individually that in the presence of such earnest purpose as the professor s a purpose which could thus use the to him most sacred of things it was impossible to distrust in respectful silence we took the places assigned to us close round the tomb but hidden from the sight of any one approaching i pitied the others especially arthur i had myself been apprenticed by my former visits to this watching horror and yet i who had up to an hour ago repudiated the proofs felt my heart sink within me never did tombs look so ghastly white never did cypress or yew or juniper so seem the embodiment of funereal gloom never did tree or grass wave or rustle so ominously never did bough creak so mysteriously and never did the far away howling of dogs send such a woeful presage through the night there was a long spell of silence a big aching void and then from the professor a keen s s s s he pointed and far down the avenue of yews we saw a white figure advance a dim white figure which held something dark at its breast the figure stopped and at the moment a ray of moonlight fell upon the masses of driving clouds and showed in startling prominence a dark haired woman dressed in the cerements of the grave we could not see the face for it was bent down over what we saw to be a fair haired child there was a pause and a sharp little cry such as a child gives in sleep or a dog as it lies before the fire and dreams we were starting forward but the professor s warning hand seen by us as he stood behind a yew tree kept us back and then as we looked the white figure moved forwards again it was now near enough for us to see clearly and the moonlight still held my own heart grew cold as ice and i could hear the gasp of arthur as we recognised the features of lucy westenra lucy westenra but yet how changed the sweetness was turned to adamantine heartless cruelty and the purity to voluptuous wantonness van helsing stepped out and obedient to his gesture we all advanced too the four of us ranged in a line before the door of the tomb van helsing raised his lantern and drew the slide by the concentrated light that fell on lucy s face we could see that the lips were crimson with fresh blood and that the stream had trickled over her chin and stained the purity of her lawn death robe we shuddered with horror i could see by the tremulous light that even van helsing s iron nerve had failed arthur was next to me and if i had not seized his arm and held him up he would have fallen when lucy i call the thing that was before us lucy because it bore her shape saw us she drew back with an angry snarl such as a cat gives when taken unawares then her eyes ranged over us lucy s eyes in form and colour but lucy s eyes unclean and full of hell fire instead of the pure gentle orbs we knew at that moment the remnant of my love passed into hate and loathing had she then to be killed i could have done it with savage delight as she looked her eyes blazed with unholy light and the face became wreathed with a voluptuous smile oh god how it made me shudder to see it with a careless motion she flung to the ground callous as a devil the child that up to now she had clutched strenuously to her breast growling over it as a dog growls over a bone the child gave a sharp cry and lay there moaning there was a cold bloodedness in the act which wrung a groan from arthur when she advanced to him with outstretched arms and a wanton smile he fell back and hid his face in his hands she still advanced however and with a languorous voluptuous grace said come to me arthur leave these others and come to me my arms are hungry for you come and we can rest together come my husband come there was something diabolically sweet in her tones something of the tingling of glass when struck which rang through the brains even of us who heard the words addressed to another as for arthur he seemed under a spell moving his hands from his face he opened wide his arms she was leaping for them when van helsing sprang forward and held between them his little golden crucifix she recoiled from it and with a suddenly distorted face full of rage dashed past him as if to enter the tomb when within a foot or two of the door however she stopped as if arrested by some irresistible force then she turned and her face was shown in the clear burst of moonlight and by the lamp which had now no quiver from van helsing s iron nerves never did i see such baffled malice on a face and never i trust shall such ever be seen again by mortal eyes the beautiful colour became livid the eyes seemed to throw out sparks of hell fire the brows were wrinkled as though the folds of the flesh were the coils of medusa s snakes and the lovely blood stained mouth grew to an open square as in the passion masks of the greeks and japanese if ever a face meant death if looks could kill we saw it at that moment and so for full half a minute which seemed an eternity she remained between the lifted crucifix and the sacred closing of her means of entry van helsing broke the silence by asking arthur answer me oh my friend am i to proceed in my work arthur threw himself on his knees and hid his face in his hands as he answered do as you will friend do as you will there can be no horror like this ever any more and he groaned in spirit quincey and i simultaneously moved towards him and took his arms we could hear the click of the closing lantern as van helsing held it down coming close to the tomb he began to remove from the chinks some of the sacred emblem which he had placed there we all looked on in horrified amazement as we saw when he stood back the woman with a corporeal body as real at that moment as our own pass in through the interstice where scarce a knife blade could have gone we all felt a glad sense of relief when we saw the professor calmly restoring the strings of putty to the edges of the door when this was done he lifted the child and said come now my friends we can do no more till to morrow there is a funeral at noon so here we shall all come before long after that the friends of the dead will all be gone by two and when the sexton lock the gate we shall remain then there is more to do but not like this of to night as for this little one he is not much harm and by to morrow night he shall be well we shall leave him where the police will find him as on the other night and then to home coming close to arthur he said my friend arthur you have had a sore trial but after when you look back you will see how it was necessary you are now in the bitter waters my child by this time to morrow you will please god have passed them and have drunk of the sweet waters so do not mourn overmuch till then i shall not ask you to forgive me arthur and quincey came home with me and we tried to cheer each other on the way we had left the child in safety and were tired so we all slept with more or less reality of sleep september night a little before twelve o clock we three arthur quincey morris and myself called for the professor it was odd to notice that by common consent we had all put on black clothes of course arthur wore black for he was in deep mourning but the rest of us wore it by instinct we got to the churchyard by half past one and strolled about keeping out of official observation so that when the gravediggers had completed their task and the sexton under the belief that every one had gone had locked the gate we had the place all to ourselves van helsing instead of his little black bag had with him a long leather one something like a cricketing bag it was manifestly of fair weight when we were alone and had heard the last of the footsteps die out up the road we silently and as if by ordered intention followed the professor to the tomb he unlocked the door and we entered closing it behind us then he took from his bag the lantern which he lit and also two wax candles which when lighted he stuck by melting their own ends on other coffins so that they might give light sufficient to work by when he again lifted the lid off lucy s coffin we all looked arthur trembling like an aspen and saw that the body lay there in all its death beauty but there was no love in my own heart nothing but loathing for the foul thing which had taken lucy s shape without her soul i could see even arthur s face grow hard as he looked presently he said to van helsing is this really lucy s body or only a demon in her shape it is her body and yet not it but wait a while and you all see her as she was and is she seemed like a nightmare of lucy as she lay there the pointed teeth the bloodstained voluptuous mouth which it made one shudder to see the whole carnal and unspiritual appearance seeming like a devilish mockery of lucy s sweet purity van helsing with his usual methodicalness began taking the various contents from his bag and placing them ready for use first he took out a soldering iron and some plumbing solder and then a small oil lamp which gave out when lit in a corner of the tomb gas which burned at fierce heat with a blue flame then his operating knives which he placed to hand and last a round wooden stake some two and a half or three inches thick and about three feet long one end of it was hardened by charring in the fire and was sharpened to a fine point with this stake came a heavy hammer such as in households is used in the coal cellar for breaking the lumps to me a doctor s preparations for work of any kind are stimulating and bracing but the effect of these things on both arthur and quincey was to cause them a sort of consternation they both however kept their courage and remained silent and quiet when all was ready van helsing said before we do anything let me tell you this it is out of the lore and experience of the ancients and of all those who have studied the powers of the un dead when they become such there comes with the change the curse of immortality they cannot die but must go on age after age adding new victims and multiplying the evils of the world for all that die from the preying of the un dead becomes themselves un dead and prey on their kind and so the circle goes on ever widening like as the ripples from a stone thrown in the water friend arthur if you had met that kiss which you know of before poor lucy die or again last night when you open your arms to her you would in time when you had died have become nosferatu as they call it in eastern europe and would all time make more of those un deads that so have fill us with horror the career of this so unhappy dear lady is but just begun those children whose blood she suck are not as yet so much the worse but if she live on un dead more and more they lose their blood and by her power over them they come to her and so she draw their blood with that so wicked mouth but if she die in truth then all cease the tiny wounds of the throats disappear and they go back to their plays unknowing ever of what has been but of the most blessed of all when this now un dead be made to rest as true dead then the soul of the poor lady whom we love shall again be free instead of working wickedness by night and growing more debased in the assimilating of it by day she shall take her place with the other angels so that my friend it will be a blessed hand for her that shall strike the blow that sets her free to this i am willing but is there none amongst us who has a better right will it be no joy to think of hereafter in the silence of the night when sleep is not it was my hand that sent her to the stars it was the hand of him that loved her best the hand that of all she would herself have chosen had it been to her to choose tell me if there be such a one amongst us we all looked at arthur he saw too what we all did the infinite kindness which suggested that his should be the hand which would restore lucy to us as a holy and not an unholy memory he stepped forward and said bravely though his hand trembled and his face was as pale as snow my true friend from the bottom of my broken heart i thank you tell me what i am to do and i shall not falter van helsing laid a hand on his shoulder and said brave lad a moment s courage and it is done this stake must be driven through her it will be a fearful ordeal be not deceived in that but it will be only a short time and you will then rejoice more than your pain was great from this grim tomb you will emerge as though you tread on air but you must not falter when once you have begun only think that we your true friends are round you and that we pray for you all the time go on said arthur hoarsely tell me what i am to do take this stake in your left hand ready to place the point over the heart and the hammer in your right then when we begin our prayer for the dead i shall read him i have here the book and the others shall follow strike in god s name that so all may be well with the dead that we love and that the un dead pass away arthur took the stake and the hammer and when once his mind was set on action his hands never trembled nor even quivered van helsing opened his missal and began to read and quincey and i followed as well as we could arthur placed the point over the heart and as i looked i could see its dint in the white flesh then he struck with all his might the thing in the coffin writhed and a hideous blood curdling screech came from the opened red lips the body shook and quivered and twisted in wild contortions the sharp white teeth champed together till the lips were cut and the mouth was smeared with a crimson foam but arthur never faltered he looked like a figure of thor as his untrembling arm rose and fell driving deeper and deeper the mercy bearing stake whilst the blood from the pierced heart welled and spurted up around it his face was set and high duty seemed to shine through it the sight of it gave us courage so that our voices seemed to ring through the little vault and then the writhing and quivering of the body became less and the teeth seemed to champ and the face to quiver finally it lay still the terrible task was over the hammer fell from arthur s hand he reeled and would have fallen had we not caught him the great drops of sweat sprang from his forehead and his breath came in broken gasps it had indeed been an awful strain on him and had he not been forced to his task by more than human considerations he could never have gone through with it for a few minutes we were so taken up with him that we did not look towards the coffin when we did however a murmur of startled surprise ran from one to the other of us we gazed so eagerly that arthur rose for he had been seated on the ground and came and looked too and then a glad strange light broke over his face and dispelled altogether the gloom of horror that lay upon it there in the coffin lay no longer the foul thing that we had so dreaded and grown to hate that the work of her destruction was yielded as a privilege to the one best entitled to it but lucy as we had seen her in her life with her face of unequalled sweetness and purity true that there were there as we had seen them in life the traces of care and pain and waste but these were all dear to us for they marked her truth to what we knew one and all we felt that the holy calm that lay like sunshine over the wasted face and form was only an earthly token and symbol of the calm that was to reign for ever van helsing came and laid his hand on arthur s shoulder and said to him and now arthur my friend dear lad am i not forgiven the reaction of the terrible strain came as he took the old man s hand in his and raising it to his lips pressed it and said forgiven god bless you that you have given my dear one her soul again and me peace he put his hands on the professor s shoulder and laying his head on his breast cried for a while silently whilst we stood unmoving when he raised his head van helsing said to him and now my child you may kiss her kiss her dead lips if you will as she would have you to if for her to choose for she is not a grinning devil now not any more a foul thing for all eternity no longer she is the devil s un dead she is god s true dead whose soul is with him arthur bent and kissed her and then we sent him and quincey out of the tomb the professor and i sawed the top off the stake leaving the point of it in the body then we cut off the head and filled the mouth with garlic we soldered up the leaden coffin screwed on the coffin lid and gathering up our belongings came away when the professor locked the door he gave the key to arthur outside the air was sweet the sun shone and the birds sang and it seemed as if all nature were tuned to a different pitch there was gladness and mirth and peace everywhere for we were at rest ourselves on one account and we were glad though it was with a tempered joy before we moved away van helsing said now my friends one step of our work is done one the most harrowing to ourselves but there remains a greater task to find out the author of all this our sorrow and to stamp him out i have clues which we can follow but it is a long task and a difficult and there is danger in it and pain shall you not all help me we have learned to believe all of us is it not so and since so do we not see our duty yes and do we not promise to go on to the bitter end each in turn we took his hand and the promise was made then said the professor as we moved off two nights hence you shall meet with me and dine together at seven of the clock with friend john i shall entreat two others two that you know not as yet and i shall be ready to all our work show and our plans unfold friend john you come with me home for i have much to consult about and you can help me to night i leave for amsterdam but shall return to morrow night and then begins our great quest but first i shall have much to say so that you may know what is to do and to dread then our promise shall be made to each other anew for there is a terrible task before us and once our feet are on the ploughshare we must not draw back chapter xvii dr seward s diary continued when we arrived at the berkeley hotel van helsing found a telegram waiting for him am coming up by train jonathan at whitby important news mina harker the professor was delighted ah that wonderful madam mina he said pearl among women she arrive but i cannot stay she must go to your house friend john you must meet her at the station telegraph her en route so that she may be prepared when the wire was despatched he had a cup of tea over it he told me of a diary kept by jonathan harker when abroad and gave me a typewritten copy of it as also of mrs harker s diary at whitby take these he said and study them well when i have returned you will be master of all the facts and we can then better enter on our inquisition keep them safe for there is in them much of treasure you will need all your faith even you who have had such an experience as that of to day what is here told he laid his hand heavily and gravely on the packet of papers as he spoke may be the beginning of the end to you and me and many another or it may sound the knell of the un dead who walk the earth read all i pray you with the open mind and if you can add in any way to the story here told do so for it is all important you have kept diary of all these so strange things is it not so yes then we shall go through all these together when we meet he then made ready for his departure and shortly after drove off to liverpool street i took my way to paddington where i arrived about fifteen minutes before the train came in the crowd melted away after the bustling fashion common to arrival platforms and i was beginning to feel uneasy lest i might miss my guest when a sweet faced dainty looking girl stepped up to me and after a quick glance said dr seward is it not and you are mrs harker i answered at once whereupon she held out her hand i knew you from the description of poor dear lucy but she stopped suddenly and a quick blush overspread her face the blush that rose to my own cheeks somehow set us both at ease for it was a tacit answer to her own i got her luggage which included a typewriter and we took the underground to fenchurch street after i had sent a wire to my housekeeper to have a sitting room and bedroom prepared at once for mrs harker in due time we arrived she knew of course that the place was a lunatic asylum but i could see that she was unable to repress a shudder when we entered she told me that if she might she would come presently to my study as she had much to say so here i am finishing my entry in my phonograph diary whilst i await her as yet i have not had the chance of looking at the papers which van helsing left with me though they lie open before me i must get her interested in something so that i may have an opportunity of reading them she does not know how precious time is or what a task we have in hand i must be careful not to frighten her here she is mina harker s journal september after i had tidied myself i went down to dr seward s study at the door i paused a moment for i thought i heard him talking with some one as however he had pressed me to be quick i knocked at the door and on his calling out come in i entered to my intense surprise there was no one with him he was quite alone and on the table opposite him was what i knew at once from the description to be a phonograph i had never seen one and was much interested i hope i did not keep you waiting i said but i stayed at the door as i heard you talking and thought there was some one with you oh he replied with a smile i was only entering my diary your diary i asked him in surprise yes he answered i keep it in this as he spoke he laid his hand on the phonograph i felt quite excited over it and blurted out why this beats even shorthand may i hear it say something certainly he replied with alacrity and stood up to put it in train for speaking then he paused and a troubled look overspread his face the fact is he began awkwardly i only keep my diary in it and as it is entirely almost entirely about my cases it may be awkward that is i mean he stopped and i tried to help him out of his embarrassment you helped to attend dear lucy at the end let me hear how she died for all that i know of her i shall be very grateful she was very very dear to me to my surprise he answered with a horrorstruck look in his face tell you of her death not for the wide world why not i asked for some grave terrible feeling was coming over me again he paused and i could see that he was trying to invent an excuse at length he stammered out you see i do not know how to pick out any particular part of the diary even while he was speaking an idea dawned upon him and he said with unconscious simplicity in a different voice and with the na vet of a child that s quite true upon my honour honest indian i could not but smile at which he grimaced i gave myself away that time he said but do you know that although i have kept the diary for months past it never once struck me how i was going to find any particular part of it in case i wanted to look it up by this time my mind was made up that the diary of a doctor who attended lucy might have something to add to the sum of our knowledge of that terrible being and i said boldly then dr seward you had better let me copy it out for you on my typewriter he grew to a positively deathly pallor as he said no no no for all the world i wouldn t let you know that terrible story then it was terrible my intuition was right for a moment i thought and as my eyes ranged the room unconsciously looking for something or some opportunity to aid me they lit on a great batch of typewriting on the table his eyes caught the look in mine and without his thinking followed their direction as they saw the parcel he realised my meaning you do not know me i said when you have read those papers my own diary and my husband s also which i have typed you will know me better i have not faltered in giving every thought of my own heart in this cause but of course you do not know me yet and i must not expect you to trust me so far he is certainly a man of noble nature poor dear lucy was right about him he stood up and opened a large drawer in which were arranged in order a number of hollow cylinders of metal covered with dark wax and said you are quite right i did not trust you because i did not know you but i know you now and let me say that i should have known you long ago i know that lucy told you of me she told me of you too may i make the only atonement in my power take the cylinders and hear them the first half dozen of them are personal to me and they will not horrify you then you will know me better dinner will by then be ready in the meantime i shall read over some of these documents and shall be better able to understand certain things he carried the phonograph himself up to my sitting room and adjusted it for me now i shall learn something pleasant i am sure for it will tell me the other side of a true love episode of which i know one side already dr seward s diary september i was so absorbed in that wonderful diary of jonathan harker and that other of his wife that i let the time run on without thinking mrs harker was not down when the maid came to announce dinner so i said she is possibly tired let dinner wait an hour and i went on with my work i had just finished mrs harker s diary when she came in she looked sweetly pretty but very sad and her eyes were flushed with crying this somehow moved me much of late i have had cause for tears god knows but the relief of them was denied me and now the sight of those sweet eyes brightened with recent tears went straight to my heart so i said as gently as i could i greatly fear i have distressed you oh no not distressed me she replied but i have been more touched than i can say by your grief that is a wonderful machine but it is cruelly true it told me in its very tones the anguish of your heart it was like a soul crying out to almighty god no one must hear them spoken ever again see i have tried to be useful i have copied out the words on my typewriter and none other need now hear your heart beat as i did no one need ever know shall ever know i said in a low voice she laid her hand on mine and said very gravely ah but they must must but why i asked because it is a part of the terrible story a part of poor dear lucy s death and all that led to it because in the struggle which we have before us to rid the earth of this terrible monster we must have all the knowledge and all the help which we can get i think that the cylinders which you gave me contained more than you intended me to know but i can see that there are in your record many lights to this dark mystery you will let me help will you not i know all up to a certain point and i see already though your diary only took me to september how poor lucy was beset and how her terrible doom was being wrought out jonathan and i have been working day and night since professor van helsing saw us he is gone to whitby to get more information and he will be here to morrow to help us we need have no secrets amongst us working together and with absolute trust we can surely be stronger than if some of us were in the dark she looked at me so appealingly and at the same time manifested such courage and resolution in her bearing that i gave in at once to her wishes you shall i said do as you like in the matter god forgive me if i do wrong there are terrible things yet to learn of but if you have so far travelled on the road to poor lucy s death you will not be content i know to remain in the dark nay the end the very end may give you a gleam of peace come there is dinner we must keep one another strong for what is before us we have a cruel and dreadful task when you have eaten you shall learn the rest and i shall answer any questions you ask if there be anything which you do not understand though it was apparent to us who were present mina harker s journal september after dinner i came with dr seward to his study he brought back the phonograph from my room and i took my typewriter he placed me in a comfortable chair and arranged the phonograph so that i could touch it without getting up and showed me how to stop it in case i should want to pause then he very thoughtfully took a chair with his back to me so that i might be as free as possible and began to read i put the forked metal to my ears and listened when the terrible story of lucy s death and and all that followed was done i lay back in my chair powerless fortunately i am not of a fainting disposition when dr seward saw me he jumped up with a horrified exclamation and hurriedly taking a case bottle from a cupboard gave me some brandy which in a few minutes somewhat restored me my brain was all in a whirl and only that there came through all the multitude of horrors the holy ray of light that my dear dear lucy was at last at peace i do not think i could have borne it without making a scene it is all so wild and mysterious and strange that if i had not known jonathan s experience in transylvania i could not have believed as it was i didn t know what to believe and so got out of my difficulty by attending to something else i took the cover off my typewriter and said to dr seward let me write this all out now we must be ready for dr van helsing when he comes i have sent a telegram to jonathan to come on here when he arrives in london from whitby in this matter dates are everything and i think that if we get all our material ready and have every item put in chronological order we shall have done much you tell me that lord godalming and mr morris are coming too let us be able to tell him when they come he accordingly set the phonograph at a slow pace and i began to typewrite from the beginning of the seventh cylinder i used manifold and so took three copies of the diary just as i had done with all the rest it was late when i got through but dr seward went about his work of going his round of the patients when he had finished he came back and sat near me reading so that i did not feel too lonely whilst i worked how good and thoughtful he is the world seems full of good men even if there are monsters in it before i left him i remembered what jonathan put in his diary of the professor s perturbation at reading something in an evening paper at the station at exeter so seeing that dr seward keeps his newspapers i borrowed the files of the westminster gazette and the pall mall gazette and took them to my room i remember how much the dailygraph and the whitby gazette of which i had made cuttings helped us to understand the terrible events at whitby when count dracula landed so i shall look through the evening papers since then and perhaps i shall get some new light i am not sleepy and the work will help to keep me quiet dr seward s diary september mr harker arrived at nine o clock he had got his wife s wire just before starting he is uncommonly clever if one can judge from his face and full of energy if this journal be true and judging by one s own wonderful experiences it must be he is also a man of great nerve that going down to the vault a second time was a remarkable piece of daring after reading his account of it i was prepared to meet a good specimen of manhood but hardly the quiet business like gentleman who came here to day later after lunch harker and his wife went back to their own room and as i passed a while ago i heard the click of the typewriter they are hard at it mrs harker says that they are knitting together in chronological order every scrap of evidence they have harker has got the letters between the consignee of the boxes at whitby and the carriers in london who took charge of them he is now reading his wife s typescript of my diary i wonder what they make out of it here it is strange that it never struck me that the very next house might be the count s hiding place goodness knows that we had enough clues from the conduct of the patient renfield the bundle of letters relating to the purchase of the house were with the typescript oh if we had only had them earlier we might have saved poor lucy stop that way madness lies harker has gone back and is again collating his material he says that by dinner time they will be able to show a whole connected narrative he thinks that in the meantime i should see renfield as hitherto he has been a sort of index to the coming and going of the count i hardly see this yet but when i get at the dates i suppose i shall what a good thing that mrs harker put my cylinders into type we never could have found the dates otherwise i found renfield sitting placidly in his room with his hands folded smiling benignly at the moment he seemed as sane as any one i ever saw i sat down and talked with him on a lot of subjects all of which he treated naturally he then of his own accord spoke of going home a subject he has never mentioned to my knowledge during his sojourn here in fact he spoke quite confidently of getting his discharge at once i believe that had i not had the chat with harker and read the letters and the dates of his outbursts i should have been prepared to sign for him after a brief time of observation as it is i am darkly suspicious all those outbreaks were in some way linked with the proximity of the count what then does this absolute content mean can it be that his instinct is satisfied as to the vampire s ultimate triumph stay he is himself zo phagous and in his wild ravings outside the chapel door of the deserted house he always spoke of master this all seems confirmation of our idea however after a while i came away my friend is just a little too sane at present to make it safe to probe him too deep with questions he might begin to think and then so i came away i mistrust these quiet moods of his so i have given the attendant a hint to look closely after him and to have a strait waistcoat ready in case of need jonathan harker s journal september in train to london when i received mr billington s courteous message that he would give me any information in his power i thought it best to go down to whitby and make on the spot such inquiries as i wanted it was now my object to trace that horrid cargo of the count s to its place in london later we may be able to deal with it billington junior a nice lad met me at the station and brought me to his father s house where they had decided that i must stay the night they are hospitable with true yorkshire hospitality give a guest everything and leave him free to do as he likes they all knew that i was busy and that my stay was short and mr billington had ready in his office all the papers concerning the consignment of boxes it gave me almost a turn to see again one of the letters which i had seen on the count s table before i knew of his diabolical plans everything had been carefully thought out and done systematically and with precision he seemed to have been prepared for every obstacle which might be placed by accident in the way of his intentions being carried out to use an americanism he had taken no chances and the absolute accuracy with which his instructions were fulfilled was simply the logical result of his care i saw the invoice and took note of it fifty cases of common earth to be used for experimental purposes also the copy of letter to carter paterson and their reply of both of these i got copies this was all the information mr billington could give me so i went down to the port and saw the coastguards the customs officers and the harbour master they had all something to say of the strange entry of the ship which is already taking its place in local tradition but no one could add to the simple description fifty cases of common earth i then saw the station master who kindly put me in communication with the men who had actually received the boxes their tally was exact with the list and they had nothing to add except that the boxes were main and mortal heavy and that shifting them was dry work one of them added that it was hard lines that there wasn t any gentleman such like as yourself squire to show some sort of appreciation of their efforts in a liquid form another put in a rider that the thirst then generated was such that even the time which had elapsed had not completely allayed it needless to add i took care before leaving to lift for ever and adequately this source of reproach september the station master was good enough to give me a line to his old companion the station master at king s cross so that when i arrived there in the morning i was able to ask him about the arrival of the boxes he too put me at once in communication with the proper officials and i saw that their tally was correct with the original invoice the opportunities of acquiring an abnormal thirst had been here limited a noble use of them had however been made and again i was compelled to deal with the result in an ex post facto manner from thence i went on to carter paterson s central office where i met with the utmost courtesy they looked up the transaction in their day book and letter book and at once telephoned to their king s cross office for more details by good fortune the men who did the teaming were waiting for work and the official at once sent them over sending also by one of them the way bill and all the papers connected with the delivery of the boxes at carfax here again i found the tally agreeing exactly the carriers men were able to supplement the paucity of the written words with a few details these were i shortly found connected almost solely with the dusty nature of the job and of the consequent thirst engendered in the operators on my affording an opportunity through the medium of the currency of the realm of the allaying at a later period this beneficial evil one of the men remarked that ere ouse guv nor is the rummiest i ever was in blyme but it ain t been touched sence a hundred years there was dust that thick in the place that you might have slep on it without urtin of yer bones an the place was that neglected that yer might ave smelled ole jerusalem in it but the ole chapel that took the cike that did me and my mate we thort we wouldn t never git out quick enough lor i wouldn t take less nor a quid a moment to stay there arter dark having been in the house i could well believe him but if he knew what i know he would i think have raised his terms of one thing i am now satisfied that all the boxes which arrived at whitby from varna in the demeter were safely deposited in the old chapel at carfax there should be fifty of them there unless any have since been removed as from dr seward s diary i fear i shall try to see the carter who took away the boxes from carfax when renfield attacked them by following up this clue we may learn a good deal later mina and i have worked all day and we have put all the papers into order mina harker s journal september i am so glad that i hardly know how to contain myself it is i suppose the reaction from the haunting fear which i have had that this terrible affair and the reopening of his old wound might act detrimentally on jonathan i saw him leave for whitby with as brave a face as i could but i was sick with apprehension the effort has however done him good he was never so resolute never so strong never so full of volcanic energy as at present it is just as that dear good professor van helsing said he is true grit and he improves under strain that would kill a weaker nature he came back full of life and hope and determination we have got everything in order for to night i feel myself quite wild with excitement i suppose one ought to pity any thing so hunted as is the count that is just it this thing is not human not even beast to read dr seward s account of poor lucy s death and what followed is enough to dry up the springs of pity in one s heart later lord godalming and mr morris arrived earlier than we expected dr seward was out on business and had taken jonathan with him so i had to see them it was to me a painful meeting for it brought back all poor dear lucy s hopes of only a few months ago of course they had heard lucy speak of me and it seemed that dr van helsing too has been quite blowing my trumpet as mr morris expressed it poor fellows neither of them is aware that i know all about the proposals they made to lucy they did not quite know what to say or do as they were ignorant of the amount of my knowledge so they had to keep on neutral subjects however i thought the matter over and came to the conclusion that the best thing i could do would be to post them in affairs right up to date i knew from dr seward s diary that they had been at lucy s death her real death and that i need not fear to betray any secret before the time so i told them as well as i could that i had read all the papers and diaries and that my husband and i having typewritten them had just finished putting them in order i gave them each a copy to read in the library when lord godalming got his and turned it over it does make a pretty good pile he said did you write all this mrs harker i nodded and he went on i don t quite see the drift of it but you people are all so good and kind and have been working so earnestly and so energetically that all i can do is to accept your ideas blindfold and try to help you i have had one lesson already in accepting facts that should make a man humble to the last hour of his life besides i know you loved my poor lucy here he turned away and covered his face with his hands i could hear the tears in his voice mr morris with instinctive delicacy just laid a hand for a moment on his shoulder and then walked quietly out of the room i suppose there is something in woman s nature that makes a man free to break down before her and express his feelings on the tender or emotional side without feeling it derogatory to his manhood for when lord godalming found himself alone with me he sat down on the sofa and gave way utterly and openly i sat down beside him and took his hand i hope he didn t think it forward of me and that if he ever thinks of it afterwards he never will have such a thought there i wrong him i know he never will he is too true a gentleman i said to him for i could see that his heart was breaking i loved dear lucy and i know what she was to you and what you were to her she and i were like sisters and now she is gone will you not let me be like a sister to you in your trouble i know what sorrows you have had though i cannot measure the depth of them if sympathy and pity can help in your affliction won t you let me be of some little service for lucy s sake in an instant the poor dear fellow was overwhelmed with grief it seemed to me that all that he had of late been suffering in silence found a vent at once he grew quite hysterical and raising his open hands beat his palms together in a perfect agony of grief he stood up and then sat down again and the tears rained down his cheeks i felt an infinite pity for him and opened my arms unthinkingly with a sob he laid his head on my shoulder and cried like a wearied child whilst he shook with emotion we women have something of the mother in us that makes us rise above smaller matters when the mother spirit is invoked i felt this big sorrowing man s head resting on me as though it were that of the baby that some day may lie on my bosom and i stroked his hair as though he were my own child i never thought at the time how strange it all was after a little bit his sobs ceased and he raised himself with an apology though he made no disguise of his emotion he told me that for days and nights past weary days and sleepless nights he had been unable to speak with any one as a man must speak in his time of sorrow there was no woman whose sympathy could be given to him or with whom owing to the terrible circumstance with which his sorrow was surrounded he could speak freely i know now how i suffered he said as he dried his eyes but i do not know even yet and none other can ever know how much your sweet sympathy has been to me to day i shall know better in time and believe me that though i am not ungrateful now my gratitude will grow with my understanding you will let me be like a brother will you not for all our lives for dear lucy s sake for dear lucy s sake i said as we clasped hands ay and for your own sake he added for if a man s esteem and gratitude are ever worth the winning you have won mine to day if ever the future should bring to you a time when you need a man s help believe me you will not call in vain god grant that no such time may ever come to you to break the sunshine of your life but if it should ever come promise me that you will let me know he was so earnest and his sorrow was so fresh that i felt it would comfort him so i said i promise as i came along the corridor i saw mr morris looking out of a window he turned as he heard my footsteps how is art he said then noticing my red eyes he went on ah i see you have been comforting him poor old fellow he needs it no one but a woman can help a man when he is in trouble of the heart and he had no one to comfort him he bore his own trouble so bravely that my heart bled for him i saw the manuscript in his hand and i knew that when he read it he would realise how much i knew so i said to him i wish i could comfort all who suffer from the heart will you let me be your friend and will you come to me for comfort if you need it you will know later on why i speak he saw that i was in earnest and stooping took my hand and raising it to his lips kissed it it seemed but poor comfort to so brave and unselfish a soul and impulsively i bent over and kissed him the tears rose in his eyes and there was a momentary choking in his throat he said quite calmly little girl you will never regret that true hearted kindness so long as ever you live then he went into the study to his friend little girl the very words he had used to lucy and oh but he proved himself a friend chapter xviii dr seward s diary september i got home at five o clock and found that godalming and morris had not only arrived but had already studied the transcript of the various diaries and letters which harker and his wonderful wife had made and arranged harker had not yet returned from his visit to the carriers men of whom dr hennessey had written to me mrs harker gave us a cup of tea and i can honestly say that for the first time since i have lived in it this old house seemed like home when we had finished mrs harker said dr seward may i ask a favour i want to see your patient mr renfield do let me see him what you have said of him in your diary interests me so much she looked so appealing and so pretty that i could not refuse her and there was no possible reason why i should so i took her with me when i went into the room i told the man that a lady would like to see him to which he simply answered why she is going through the house and wants to see every one in it i answered oh very well he said let her come in by all means but just wait a minute till i tidy up the place his method of tidying was peculiar he simply swallowed all the flies and spiders in the boxes before i could stop him it was quite evident that he feared or was jealous of some interference when he had got through his disgusting task he said cheerfully let the lady come in and sat down on the edge of his bed with his head down but with his eyelids raised so that he could see her as she entered for a moment i thought that he might have some homicidal intent i remembered how quiet he had been just before he attacked me in my own study and i took care to stand where i could seize him at once if he attempted to make a spring at her she came into the room with an easy gracefulness which would at once command the respect of any lunatic for easiness is one of the qualities mad people most respect she walked over to him smiling pleasantly and held out her hand good evening mr renfield said she you see i know you for dr seward has told me of you he made no immediate reply but eyed her all over intently with a set frown on his face this look gave way to one of wonder which merged in doubt then to my intense astonishment he said you re not the girl the doctor wanted to marry are you you can t be you know for she s dead mrs harker smiled sweetly as she replied oh no i have a husband of my own to whom i was married before i ever saw dr seward or he me i am mrs harker then what are you doing here my husband and i are staying on a visit with dr seward then don t stay but why not i thought that this style of conversation might not be pleasant to mrs harker any more than it was to me so i joined in how did you know i wanted to marry any one his reply was simply contemptuous given in a pause in which he turned his eyes from mrs harker to me instantly turning them back again what an asinine question i don t see that at all mr renfield said mrs harker at once championing me he replied to her with as much courtesy and respect as he had shown contempt to me you will of course understand mrs harker that when a man is so loved and honoured as our host is everything regarding him is of interest in our little community dr seward is loved not only by his household and his friends but even by his patients who being some of them hardly in mental equilibrium are apt to distort causes and effects since i myself have been an inmate of a lunatic asylum i cannot but notice that the sophistic tendencies of some of its inmates lean towards the errors of non causa and ignoratio elenchi i positively opened my eyes at this new development here was my own pet lunatic the most pronounced of his type that i had ever met with talking elemental philosophy and with the manner of a polished gentleman i wonder if it was mrs harker s presence which had touched some chord in his memory if this new phase was spontaneous or in any way due to her unconscious influence she must have some rare gift or power we continued to talk for some time and seeing that he was seemingly quite reasonable she ventured looking at me questioningly as she began to lead him to his favourite topic i was again astonished for he addressed himself to the question with the impartiality of the completest sanity he even took himself as an example when he mentioned certain things why i myself am an instance of a man who had a strange belief indeed it was no wonder that my friends were alarmed and insisted on my being put under control i used to fancy that life was a positive and perpetual entity and that by consuming a multitude of live things no matter how low in the scale of creation one might indefinitely prolong life at times i held the belief so strongly that i actually tried to take human life the doctor here will bear me out that on one occasion i tried to kill him for the purpose of strengthening my vital powers by the assimilation with my own body of his life through the medium of his blood relying of course upon the scriptural phrase for the blood is the life though indeed the vendor of a certain nostrum has vulgarised the truism to the very point of contempt isn t that true doctor i nodded assent for i was so amazed that i hardly knew what to either think or say it was hard to imagine that i had seen him eat up his spiders and flies not five minutes before looking at my watch i saw that i should go to the station to meet van helsing so i told mrs harker that it was time to leave she came at once after saying pleasantly to mr renfield good bye and i hope i may see you often under auspices pleasanter to yourself to which to my astonishment he replied good bye my dear i pray god i may never see your sweet face again may he bless and keep you when i went to the station to meet van helsing i left the boys behind me poor art seemed more cheerful than he has been since lucy first took ill and quincey is more like his own bright self than he has been for many a long day van helsing stepped from the carriage with the eager nimbleness of a boy he saw me at once and rushed up to me saying ah friend john how goes all well so i have been busy for i come here to stay if need be all affairs are settled with me and i have much to tell madam mina is with you yes and her so fine husband and arthur and my friend quincey they are with you too good as i drove to the house i told him of what had passed and of how my own diary had come to be of some use through mrs harker s suggestion at which the professor interrupted me ah that wonderful madam mina she has man s brain a brain that a man should have were he much gifted and a woman s heart the good god fashioned her for a purpose believe me when he made that so good combination friend john up to now fortune has made that woman of help to us after to night she must not have to do with this so terrible affair it is not good that she run a risk so great we men are determined nay are we not pledged to destroy this monster but it is no part for a woman even if she be not harmed her heart may fail her in so much and so many horrors and hereafter she may suffer both in waking from her nerves and in sleep from her dreams and besides she is young woman and not so long married there may be other things to think of some time if not now you tell me she has wrote all then she must consult with us but to morrow she say good bye to this work and we go alone i agreed heartily with him and then i told him what we had found in his absence that the house which dracula had bought was the very next one to my own he was amazed and a great concern seemed to come on him oh that we had known it before he said for then we might have reached him in time to save poor lucy however the milk that is spilt cries not out afterwards as you say we shall not think of that but go on our way to the end then he fell into a silence that lasted till we entered my own gateway before we went to prepare for dinner he said to mrs harker i am told madam mina by my friend john that you and your husband have put up in exact order all things that have been up to this moment not up to this moment professor she said impulsively but up to this morning but why not up to now we have seen hitherto how good light all the little things have made we have told our secrets and yet no one who has told is the worse for it mrs harker began to blush and taking a paper from her pockets she said dr van helsing will you read this and tell me if it must go in it is my record of to day i too have seen the need of putting down at present everything however trivial but there is little in this except what is personal must it go in the professor read it over gravely and handed it back saying it need not go in if you do not wish it but i pray that it may it can but make your husband love you the more and all us your friends more honour you as well as more esteem and love she took it back with another blush and a bright smile and so now up to this very hour all the records we have are complete and in order the professor took away one copy to study after dinner and before our meeting which is fixed for nine o clock the rest of us have already read everything so when we meet in the study we shall all be informed as to facts and can arrange our plan of battle with this terrible and mysterious enemy mina harker s journal september when we met in dr seward s study two hours after dinner which had been at six o clock we unconsciously formed a sort of board or committee professor van helsing took the head of the table to which dr seward motioned him as he came into the room he made me sit next to him on his right and asked me to act as secretary jonathan sat next to me opposite us were lord godalming dr seward and mr morris lord godalming being next the professor and dr seward in the centre the professor said i may i suppose take it that we are all acquainted with the facts that are in these papers we all expressed assent and he went on then it were i think good that i tell you something of the kind of enemy with which we have to deal i shall then make known to you something of the history of this man which has been ascertained for me so we then can discuss how we shall act and can take our measure according there are such beings as vampires some of us have evidence that they exist even had we not the proof of our own unhappy experience the teachings and the records of the past give proof enough for sane peoples i admit that at the first i was sceptic were it not that through long years i have train myself to keep an open mind i could not have believe until such time as that fact thunder on my ear see see i prove i prove alas had i known at the first what now i know nay had i even guess at him one so precious life had been spared to many of us who did love her but that is gone and we must so work that other poor souls perish not whilst we can save the nosferatu do not die like the bee when he sting once he is only stronger and being stronger have yet more power to work evil this vampire which is amongst us is of himself so strong in person as twenty men he is of cunning more than mortal for his cunning be the growth of ages he have still the aids of necromancy which is as his etymology imply the divination by the dead and all the dead that he can come nigh to are for him at command he is brute and more than brute he is devil in callous and the heart of him is not he can within limitations appear at will when and where and in any of the forms that are to him he can within his range direct the elements the storm the fog the thunder he can command all the meaner things the rat and the owl and the bat the moth and the fox and the wolf he can grow and become small and he can at times vanish and come unknown how then are we to begin our strike to destroy him how shall we find his where and having found it how can we destroy my friends this is much it is a terrible task that we undertake and there may be consequence to make the brave shudder for if we fail in this our fight he must surely win and then where end we life is nothings i heed him not but to fail here is not mere life or death it is that we become as him that we henceforward become foul things of the night like him without heart or conscience preying on the bodies and the souls of those we love best to us for ever are the gates of heaven shut for who shall open them to us again we go on for all time abhorred by all a blot on the face of god s sunshine an arrow in the side of him who died for man but we are face to face with duty and in such case must we shrink for me i say no but then i am old and life with his sunshine his fair places his song of birds his music and his love lie far behind you others are young some have seen sorrow but there are fair days yet in store what say you whilst he was speaking jonathan had taken my hand i feared oh so much that the appalling nature of our danger was overcoming him when i saw his hand stretch out but it was life to me to feel its touch so strong so self reliant so resolute a brave man s hand can speak for itself it does not even need a woman s love to hear its music when the professor had done speaking my husband looked in my eyes and i in his there was no need for speaking between us i answer for mina and myself he said count me in professor said mr quincey morris laconically as usual i am with you said lord godalming for lucy s sake if for no other reason dr seward simply nodded the professor stood up and after laying his golden crucifix on the table held out his hand on either side i took his right hand and lord godalming his left jonathan held my right with his left and stretched across to mr morris so as we all took hands our solemn compact was made i felt my heart icy cold but it did not even occur to me to draw back we resumed our places and dr van helsing went on with a sort of cheerfulness which showed that the serious work had begun it was to be taken as gravely and in as businesslike a way as any other transaction of life well you know what we have to contend against but we too are not without strength we have on our side power of combination a power denied to the vampire kind we have sources of science we are free to act and think and the hours of the day and the night are ours equally in fact so far as our powers extend they are unfettered and we are free to use them we have self devotion in a cause and an end to achieve which is not a selfish one these things are much now let us see how far the general powers arrayed against us are restrict and how the individual cannot in fine let us consider the limitations of the vampire in general and of this one in particular all we have to go upon are traditions and superstitions these do not at the first appear much when the matter is one of life and death nay of more than either life or death yet must we be satisfied in the first place because we have to be no other means is at our control and secondly because after all these things tradition and superstition are everything does not the belief in vampires rest for others though not alas for us on them a year ago which of us would have received such a possibility in the midst of our scientific sceptical matter of fact nineteenth century we even scouted a belief that we saw justified under our very eyes take it then that the vampire and the belief in his limitations and his cure rest for the moment on the same base for let me tell you he is known everywhere that men have been in old greece in old rome he flourish in germany all over in france in india even in the chernosese and in china so far from us in all ways there even is he and the peoples fear him at this day he have follow the wake of the berserker icelander the devil begotten hun the slav the saxon the magyar so far then we have all we may act upon and let me tell you that very much of the beliefs are justified by what we have seen in our own so unhappy experience the vampire live on and cannot die by mere passing of the time he can flourish when that he can fatten on the blood of the living even more we have seen amongst us that he can even grow younger that his vital faculties grow strenuous and seem as though they refresh themselves when his special pabulum is plenty but he cannot flourish without this diet he eat not as others even friend jonathan who lived with him for weeks did never see him to eat never he throws no shadow he make in the mirror no reflect as again jonathan observe he has the strength of many of his hand witness again jonathan when he shut the door against the wolfs and when he help him from the diligence too he can transform himself to wolf as we gather from the ship arrival in whitby when he tear open the dog he can be as bat as madam mina saw him on the window at whitby and as friend john saw him fly from this so near house and as my friend quincey saw him at the window of miss lucy he can come in mist which he create that noble ship s captain proved him of this but from what we know the distance he can make this mist is limited and it can only be round himself he come on moonlight rays as elemental dust as again jonathan saw those sisters in the castle of dracula he become so small we ourselves saw miss lucy ere she was at peace slip through a hairbreadth space at the tomb door he can when once he find his way come out from anything or into anything no matter how close it be bound or even fused up with fire solder you call it he can see in the dark no small power this in a world which is one half shut from the light ah but hear me through he can do all these things yet he is not free nay he is even more prisoner than the slave of the galley than the madman in his cell he cannot go where he lists he who is not of nature has yet to obey some of nature s laws why we know not he may not enter anywhere at the first unless there be some one of the household who bid him to come though afterwards he can come as he please his power ceases as does that of all evil things at the coming of the day only at certain times can he have limited freedom if he be not at the place whither he is bound he can only change himself at noon or at exact sunrise or sunset these things are we told and in this record of ours we have proof by inference thus whereas he can do as he will within his limit when he have his earth home his coffin home his hell home the place unhallowed as we saw when he went to the grave of the suicide at whitby still at other time he can only change when the time come it is said too that he can only pass running water at the slack or the flood of the tide then there are things which so afflict him that he has no power as the garlic that we know of and as for things sacred as this symbol my crucifix that was amongst us even now when we resolve to them he is nothing but in their presence he take his place far off and silent with respect there are others too which i shall tell you of lest in our seeking we may need them the branch of wild rose on his coffin keep him that he move not from it a sacred bullet fired into the coffin kill him so that he be true dead and as for the stake through him we know already of its peace or the cut off head that giveth rest we have seen it with our eyes thus when we find the habitation of this man that was we can confine him to his coffin and destroy him if we obey what we know but he is clever i have asked my friend arminius of buda pesth university to make his record and from all the means that are he tell me of what he has been he must indeed have been that voivode dracula who won his name against the turk over the great river on the very frontier of turkey land if it be so then was he no common man for in that time and for centuries after he was spoken of as the cleverest and the most cunning as well as the bravest of the sons of the land beyond the forest that mighty brain and that iron resolution went with him to his grave and are even now arrayed against us the draculas were says arminius a great and noble race though now and again were scions who were held by their coevals to have had dealings with the evil one they learned his secrets in the scholomance amongst the mountains over lake hermanstadt where the devil claims the tenth scholar as his due in the records are such words as stregoica witch ordog and pokol satan and hell and in one manuscript this very dracula is spoken of as wampyr which we all understand too well there have been from the loins of this very one great men and good women and their graves make sacred the earth where alone this foulness can dwell for it is not the least of its terrors that this evil thing is rooted deep in all good in soil barren of holy memories it cannot rest whilst they were talking mr morris was looking steadily at the window and he now got up quietly and went out of the room there was a little pause and then the professor went on and now we must settle what we do we have here much data and we must proceed to lay out our campaign we know from the inquiry of jonathan that from the castle to whitby came fifty boxes of earth all of which were delivered at carfax we also know that at least some of these boxes have been removed it seems to me that our first step should be to ascertain whether all the rest remain in the house beyond that wall where we look to day or whether any more have been removed if the latter we must trace here we were interrupted in a very startling way outside the house came the sound of a pistol shot the glass of the window was shattered with a bullet which ricochetting from the top of the embrasure struck the far wall of the room i am afraid i am at heart a coward for i shrieked out the men all jumped to their feet lord godalming flew over to the window and threw up the sash as he did so we heard mr morris s voice without sorry i fear i have alarmed you i shall come in and tell you about it a minute later he came in and said it was an idiotic thing of me to do and i ask your pardon mrs harker most sincerely i fear i must have frightened you terribly but the fact is that whilst the professor was talking there came a big bat and sat on the window sill i have got such a horror of the damned brutes from recent events that i cannot stand them and i went out to have a shot as i have been doing of late of evenings whenever i have seen one you used to laugh at me for it then art did you hit it asked dr van helsing i don t know i fancy not for it flew away into the wood without saying any more he took his seat and the professor began to resume his statement we must trace each of these boxes and when we are ready we must either capture or kill this monster in his lair or we must so to speak sterilise the earth so that no more he can seek safety in it thus in the end we may find him in his form of man between the hours of noon and sunset and so engage with him when he is at his most weak and now for you madam mina this night is the end until all be well you are too precious to us to have such risk when we part to night you no more must question we shall tell you all in good time we are men and are able to bear but you must be our star and our hope and we shall act all the more free that you are not in the danger such as we are all the men even jonathan seemed relieved but it did not seem to me good that they should brave danger and perhaps lessen their safety strength being the best safety through care of me but their minds were made up and though it was a bitter pill for me to swallow i could say nothing save to accept their chivalrous care of me mr morris resumed the discussion as there is no time to lose i vote we have a look at his house right now time is everything with him and swift action on our part may save another victim i own that my heart began to fail me when the time for action came so close but i did not say anything for i had a greater fear that if i appeared as a drag or a hindrance to their work they might even leave me out of their counsels altogether they have now gone off to carfax with means to get into the house manlike they had told me to go to bed and sleep as if a woman can sleep when those she loves are in danger i shall lie down and pretend to sleep lest jonathan have added anxiety about me when he returns dr seward s diary october a m just as we were about to leave the house an urgent message was brought to me from renfield to know if i would see him at once as he had something of the utmost importance to say to me i told the messenger to say that i would attend to his wishes in the morning i was busy just at the moment the attendant added he seems very importunate sir i have never seen him so eager i don t know but what if you don t see him soon he will have one of his violent fits i knew the man would not have said this without some cause so i said all right i ll go now and i asked the others to wait a few minutes for me as i had to go and see my patient take me with you friend john said the professor his case in your diary interest me much and it had bearing too now and again on our case i should much like to see him and especial when his mind is disturbed may i come also asked lord godalming me too said quincey morris may i come said harker i nodded and we all went down the passage together we found him in a state of considerable excitement but far more rational in his speech and manner than i had ever seen him there was an unusual understanding of himself which was unlike anything i had ever met with in a lunatic and he took it for granted that his reasons would prevail with others entirely sane we all four went into the room but none of the others at first said anything his request was that i would at once release him from the asylum and send him home this he backed up with arguments regarding his complete recovery and adduced his own existing sanity i appeal to your friends he said they will perhaps not mind sitting in judgment on my case by the way you have not introduced me i was so much astonished that the oddness of introducing a madman in an asylum did not strike me at the moment and besides there was a certain dignity in the man s manner so much of the habit of equality that i at once made the introduction lord godalming professor van helsing mr quincey morris of texas mr renfield he shook hands with each of them saying in turn lord godalming i had the honour of seconding your father at the windham i grieve to know by your holding the title that he is no more he was a man loved and honoured by all who knew him and in his youth was i have heard the inventor of a burnt rum punch much patronised on derby night mr morris you should be proud of your great state its reception into the union was a precedent which may have far reaching effects hereafter when the pole and the tropics may hold alliance to the stars and stripes the power of treaty may yet prove a vast engine of enlargement when the monroe doctrine takes its true place as a political fable what shall any man say of his pleasure at meeting van helsing sir i make no apology for dropping all forms of conventional prefix when an individual has revolutionised therapeutics by his discovery of the continuous evolution of brain matter conventional forms are unfitting since they would seem to limit him to one of a class you gentlemen who by nationality by heredity or by the possession of natural gifts are fitted to hold your respective places in the moving world i take to witness that i am as sane as at least the majority of men who are in full possession of their liberties and i am sure that you dr seward humanitarian and medico jurist as well as scientist will deem it a moral duty to deal with me as one to be considered as under exceptional circumstances he made this last appeal with a courtly air of conviction which was not without its own charm i think we were all staggered for my own part i was under the conviction despite my knowledge of the man s character and history that his reason had been restored and i felt under a strong impulse to tell him that i was satisfied as to his sanity and would see about the necessary formalities for his release in the morning i thought it better to wait however before making so grave a statement for of old i knew the sudden changes to which this particular patient was liable so i contented myself with making a general statement that he appeared to be improving very rapidly that i would have a longer chat with him in the morning and would then see what i could do in the direction of meeting his wishes this did not at all satisfy him for he said quickly but i fear dr seward that you hardly apprehend my wish i desire to go at once here now this very hour this very moment if i may time presses and in our implied agreement with the old scytheman it is of the essence of the contract i am sure it is only necessary to put before so admirable a practitioner as dr seward so simple yet so momentous a wish to ensure its fulfilment he looked at me keenly and seeing the negative in my face turned to the others and scrutinised them closely not meeting any sufficient response he went on is it possible that i have erred in my supposition you have i said frankly but at the same time as i felt brutally there was a considerable pause and then he said slowly then i suppose i must only shift my ground of request let me ask for this concession boon privilege what you will i am content to implore in such a case not on personal grounds but for the sake of others i am not at liberty to give you the whole of my reasons but you may i assure you take it from me that they are good ones sound and unselfish and spring from the highest sense of duty could you look sir into my heart you would approve to the full the sentiments which animate me nay more you would count me amongst the best and truest of your friends again he looked at us all keenly i had a growing conviction that this sudden change of his entire intellectual method was but yet another form or phase of his madness and so determined to let him go on a little longer knowing from experience that he would like all lunatics give himself away in the end van helsing was gazing at him with a look of utmost intensity his bushy eyebrows almost meeting with the fixed concentration of his look he said to renfield in a tone which did not surprise me at the time but only when i thought of it afterwards for it was as of one addressing an equal can you not tell frankly your real reason for wishing to be free to night i will undertake that if you will satisfy even me a stranger without prejudice and with the habit of keeping an open mind dr seward will give you at his own risk and on his own responsibility the privilege you seek he shook his head sadly and with a look of poignant regret on his face the professor went on come sir bethink yourself you claim the privilege of reason in the highest degree since you seek to impress us with your complete reasonableness you do this whose sanity we have reason to doubt since you are not yet released from medical treatment for this very defect if you will not help us in our effort to choose the wisest course how can we perform the duty which you yourself put upon us be wise and help us and if we can we shall aid you to achieve your wish he still shook his head as he said dr van helsing i have nothing to say your argument is complete and if i were free to speak i should not hesitate a moment but i am not my own master in the matter i can only ask you to trust me if i am refused the responsibility does not rest with me i thought it was now time to end the scene which was becoming too comically grave so i went towards the door simply saying come my friends we have work to do good night as however i got near the door a new change came over the patient he moved towards me so quickly that for the moment i feared that he was about to make another homicidal attack my fears however were groundless for he held up his two hands imploringly and made his petition in a moving manner as he saw that the very excess of his emotion was militating against him by restoring us more to our old relations he became still more demonstrative i glanced at van helsing and saw my conviction reflected in his eyes so i became a little more fixed in my manner if not more stern and motioned to him that his efforts were unavailing i had previously seen something of the same constantly growing excitement in him when he had to make some request of which at the time he had thought much such for instance as when he wanted a cat and i was prepared to see the collapse into the same sullen acquiescence on this occasion my expectation was not realised for when he found that his appeal would not be successful he got into quite a frantic condition he threw himself on his knees and held up his hands wringing them in plaintive supplication and poured forth a torrent of entreaty with the tears rolling down his cheeks and his whole face and form expressive of the deepest emotion let me entreat you dr seward oh let me implore you to let me out of this house at once send me away how you will and where you will send keepers with me with whips and chains let them take me in a strait waistcoat manacled and leg ironed even to a gaol but let me go out of this you don t know what you do by keeping me here i am speaking from the depths of my heart of my very soul you don t know whom you wrong or how and i may not tell woe is me i may not tell by all you hold sacred by all you hold dear by your love that is lost by your hope that lives for the sake of the almighty take me out of this and save my soul from guilt can t you hear me man can t you understand will you never learn don t you know that i am sane and earnest now that i am no lunatic in a mad fit but a sane man fighting for his soul oh hear me hear me let me go let me go let me go i thought that the longer this went on the wilder he would get and so would bring on a fit so i took him by the hand and raised him up come i said sternly no more of this we have had quite enough already get to your bed and try to behave more discreetly he suddenly stopped and looked at me intently for several moments then without a word he rose and moving over sat down on the side of the bed the collapse had come as on former occasion just as i had expected when i was leaving the room last of our party he said to me in a quiet well bred voice you will i trust dr seward do me the justice to bear in mind later on that i did what i could to convince you to night chapter xix jonathan harker s journal october a m i went with the party to the search with an easy mind for i think i never saw mina so absolutely strong and well i am so glad that she consented to hold back and let us men do the work somehow it was a dread to me that she was in this fearful business at all but now that her work is done and that it is due to her energy and brains and foresight that the whole story is put together in such a way that every point tells she may well feel that her part is finished and that she can henceforth leave the rest to us we were i think all a little upset by the scene with mr renfield when we came away from his room we were silent till we got back to the study then mr morris said to dr seward say jack if that man wasn t attempting a bluff he is about the sanest lunatic i ever saw i m not sure but i believe that he had some serious purpose and if he had it was pretty rough on him not to get a chance lord godalming and i were silent but dr van helsing added friend john you know more of lunatics than i do and i m glad of it for i fear that if it had been to me to decide i would before that last hysterical outburst have given him free but we live and learn and in our present task we must take no chance as my friend quincey would say all is best as they are dr seward seemed to answer them both in a dreamy kind of way i don t know but that i agree with you if that man had been an ordinary lunatic i would have taken my chance of trusting him but he seems so mixed up with the count in an indexy kind of way that i am afraid of doing anything wrong by helping his fads i can t forget how he prayed with almost equal fervour for a cat and then tried to tear my throat out with his teeth besides he called the count lord and master and he may want to get out to help him in some diabolical way that horrid thing has the wolves and the rats and his own kind to help him so i suppose he isn t above trying to use a respectable lunatic he certainly did seem earnest though i only hope we have done what is best these things in conjunction with the wild work we have in hand help to unnerve a man the professor stepped over and laying his hand on his shoulder said in his grave kindly way friend john have no fear we are trying to do our duty in a very sad and terrible case we can only do as we deem best what else have we to hope for except the pity of the good god lord godalming had slipped away for a few minutes but now he returned he held up a little silver whistle as he remarked that old place may be full of rats and if so i ve got an antidote on call having passed the wall we took our way to the house taking care to keep in the shadows of the trees on the lawn when the moonlight shone out when we got to the porch the professor opened his bag and took out a lot of things which he laid on the step sorting them into four little groups evidently one for each then he spoke my friends we are going into a terrible danger and we need arms of many kinds our enemy is not merely spiritual remember that he has the strength of twenty men and that though our necks or our windpipes are of the common kind and therefore breakable or crushable his are not amenable to mere strength a stronger man or a body of men more strong in all than him can at certain times hold him but they cannot hurt him as we can be hurt by him we must therefore guard ourselves from his touch keep this near your heart as he spoke he lifted a little silver crucifix and held it out to me i being nearest to him put these flowers round your neck here he handed to me a wreath of withered garlic blossoms for other enemies more mundane this revolver and this knife and for aid in all these so small electric lamps which you can fasten to your breast and for all and above all at the last this which we must not desecrate needless this was a portion of sacred wafer which he put in an envelope and handed to me each of the others was similarly equipped now he said friend john where are the skeleton keys if so that we can open the door we need not break house by the window as before at miss lucy s dr seward tried one or two skeleton keys his mechanical dexterity as a surgeon standing him in good stead presently he got one to suit after a little play back and forward the bolt yielded and with a rusty clang shot back we pressed on the door the rusty hinges creaked and it slowly opened it was startlingly like the image conveyed to me in dr seward s diary of the opening of miss westenra s tomb i fancy that the same idea seemed to strike the others for with one accord they shrank back the professor was the first to move forward and stepped into the open door in manus tuas domine he said crossing himself as he passed over the threshold we closed the door behind us lest when we should have lit our lamps we should possibly attract attention from the road the professor carefully tried the lock lest we might not be able to open it from within should we be in a hurry making our exit then we all lit our lamps and proceeded on our search the light from the tiny lamps fell in all sorts of odd forms as the rays crossed each other or the opacity of our bodies threw great shadows i could not for my life get away from the feeling that there was some one else amongst us i suppose it was the recollection so powerfully brought home to me by the grim surroundings of that terrible experience in transylvania i think the feeling was common to us all for i noticed that the others kept looking over their shoulders at every sound and every new shadow just as i felt myself doing the whole place was thick with dust the floor was seemingly inches deep except where there were recent footsteps in which on holding down my lamp i could see marks of hobnails where the dust was cracked the walls were fluffy and heavy with dust and in the corners were masses of spider s webs whereon the dust had gathered till they looked like old tattered rags as the weight had torn them partly down on a table in the hall was a great bunch of keys with a time yellowed label on each they had been used several times for on the table were several similar rents in the blanket of dust similar to that exposed when the professor lifted them he turned to me and said you know this place jonathan you have copied maps of it and you know it at least more than we do which is the way to the chapel i had an idea of its direction though on my former visit i had not been able to get admission to it so i led the way and after a few wrong turnings found myself opposite a low arched oaken door ribbed with iron bands this is the spot said the professor as he turned his lamp on a small map of the house copied from the file of my original correspondence regarding the purchase with a little trouble we found the key on the bunch and opened the door we were prepared for some unpleasantness for as we were opening the door a faint malodorous air seemed to exhale through the gaps but none of us ever expected such an odour as we encountered none of the others had met the count at all at close quarters and when i had seen him he was either in the fasting stage of his existence in his rooms or when he was gloated with fresh blood in a ruined building open to the air but here the place was small and close and the long disuse had made the air stagnant and foul there was an earthy smell as of some dry miasma which came through the fouler air but as to the odour itself how shall i describe it it was not alone that it was composed of all the ills of mortality and with the pungent acrid smell of blood but it seemed as though corruption had become itself corrupt faugh it sickens me to think of it every breath exhaled by that monster seemed to have clung to the place and intensified its loathsomeness under ordinary circumstances such a stench would have brought our enterprise to an end but this was no ordinary case and the high and terrible purpose in which we were involved gave us a strength which rose above merely physical considerations after the involuntary shrinking consequent on the first nauseous whiff we one and all set about our work as though that loathsome place were a garden of roses we made an accurate examination of the place the professor saying as we began the first thing is to see how many of the boxes are left we must then examine every hole and corner and cranny and see if we cannot get some clue as to what has become of the rest a glance was sufficient to show how many remained for the great earth chests were bulky and there was no mistaking them there were only twenty nine left out of the fifty once i got a fright for seeing lord godalming suddenly turn and look out of the vaulted door into the dark passage beyond i looked too and for an instant my heart stood still somewhere looking out from the shadow i seemed to see the high lights of the count s evil face the ridge of the nose the red eyes the red lips the awful pallor it was only for a moment for as lord godalming said i thought i saw a face but it was only the shadows and resumed his inquiry i turned my lamp in the direction and stepped into the passage there was no sign of any one and as there were no corners no doors no aperture of any kind but only the solid walls of the passage there could be no hiding place even for him i took it that fear had helped imagination and said nothing a few minutes later i saw morris step suddenly back from a corner which he was examining we all followed his movements with our eyes for undoubtedly some nervousness was growing on us and we saw a whole mass of phosphorescence which twinkled like stars we all instinctively drew back the whole place was becoming alive with rats for a moment or two we stood appalled all save lord godalming who was seemingly prepared for such an emergency rushing over to the great iron bound oaken door which dr seward had described from the outside and which i had seen myself he turned the key in the lock drew the huge bolts and swung the door open then taking his little silver whistle from his pocket he blew a low shrill call it was answered from behind dr seward s house by the yelping of dogs and after about a minute three terriers came dashing round the corner of the house unconsciously we had all moved towards the door and as we moved i noticed that the dust had been much disturbed the boxes which had been taken out had been brought this way but even in the minute that had elapsed the number of the rats had vastly increased they seemed to swarm over the place all at once till the lamplight shining on their moving dark bodies and glittering baleful eyes made the place look like a bank of earth set with fireflies the dogs dashed on but at the threshold suddenly stopped and snarled and then simultaneously lifting their noses began to howl in most lugubrious fashion the rats were multiplying in thousands and we moved out lord godalming lifted one of the dogs and carrying him in placed him on the floor the instant his feet touched the ground he seemed to recover his courage and rushed at his natural enemies they fled before him so fast that before he had shaken the life out of a score the other dogs who had by now been lifted in the same manner had but small prey ere the whole mass had vanished with their going it seemed as if some evil presence had departed for the dogs frisked about and barked merrily as they made sudden darts at their prostrate foes and turned them over and over and tossed them in the air with vicious shakes we all seemed to find our spirits rise whether it was the purifying of the deadly atmosphere by the opening of the chapel door or the relief which we experienced by finding ourselves in the open i know not but most certainly the shadow of dread seemed to slip from us like a robe and the occasion of our coming lost something of its grim significance though we did not slacken a whit in our resolution we closed the outer door and barred and locked it and bringing the dogs with us began our search of the house we found nothing throughout except dust in extraordinary proportions and all untouched save for my own footsteps when i had made my first visit never once did the dogs exhibit any symptom of uneasiness and even when we returned to the chapel they frisked about as though they had been rabbit hunting in a summer wood the morning was quickening in the east when we emerged from the front dr van helsing had taken the key of the hall door from the bunch and locked the door in orthodox fashion putting the key into his pocket when he had done so far he said our night has been eminently successful no harm has come to us such as i feared might be and yet we have ascertained how many boxes are missing more than all do i rejoice that this our first and perhaps our most difficult and dangerous step has been accomplished without the bringing thereinto our most sweet madam mina or troubling her waking or sleeping thoughts with sights and sounds and smells of horror which she might never forget one lesson too we have learned if it be allowable to argue a particulari that the brute beasts which are to the count s command are yet themselves not amenable to his spiritual power for look these rats that would come to his call just as from his castle top he summon the wolves to your going and to that poor mother s cry though they come to him they run pell mell from the so little dogs of my friend arthur we have other matters before us other dangers other fears and that monster he has not used his power over the brute world for the only or the last time to night so be it that he has gone elsewhere good it has given us opportunity to cry check in some ways in this chess game which we play for the stake of human souls and now let us go home the dawn is close at hand and we have reason to be content with our first night s work it may be ordained that we have many nights and days to follow if full of peril but we must go on and from no danger shall we shrink the house was silent when we got back save for some poor creature who was screaming away in one of the distant wards and a low moaning sound from renfield s room the poor wretch was doubtless torturing himself after the manner of the insane with needless thoughts of pain i came tiptoe into our own room and found mina asleep breathing so softly that i had to put my ear down to hear it she looks paler than usual i hope the meeting to night has not upset her i am truly thankful that she is to be left out of our future work and even of our deliberations it is too great a strain for a woman to bear i did not think so at first but i know better now therefore i am glad that it is settled there may be things which would frighten her to hear and yet to conceal them from her might be worse than to tell her if once she suspected that there was any concealment henceforth our work is to be a sealed book to her till at least such time as we can tell her that all is finished and the earth free from a monster of the nether world i daresay it will be difficult to begin to keep silence after such confidence as ours but i must be resolute and to morrow i shall keep dark over to night s doings and shall refuse to speak of anything that has happened i rest on the sofa so as not to disturb her october later i suppose it was natural that we should have all overslept ourselves for the day was a busy one and the night had no rest at all even mina must have felt its exhaustion for though i slept till the sun was high i was awake before her and had to call two or three times before she awoke indeed she was so sound asleep that for a few seconds she did not recognize me but looked at me with a sort of blank terror as one looks who has been waked out of a bad dream she complained a little of being tired and i let her rest till later in the day we now know of twenty one boxes having been removed and if it be that several were taken in any of these removals we may be able to trace them all such will of course immensely simplify our labour and the sooner the matter is attended to the better i shall look up thomas snelling to day dr seward s diary october it was towards noon when i was awakened by the professor walking into my room he was more jolly and cheerful than usual and it is quite evident that last night s work has helped to take some of the brooding weight off his mind after going over the adventure of the night he suddenly said your patient interests me much may it be that with you i visit him this morning or if that you are too occupy i can go alone if it may be it is a new experience to me to find a lunatic who talk philosophy and reason so sound i had some work to do which pressed so i told him that if he would go alone i would be glad as then i should not have to keep him waiting so i called an attendant and gave him the necessary instructions before the professor left the room i cautioned him against getting any false impression from my patient but he answered i want him to talk of himself and of his delusion as to consuming live things he said to madam mina as i see in your diary of yesterday that he had once had such a belief why do you smile friend john excuse me i said but the answer is here i laid my hand on the type written matter when our sane and learned lunatic made that very statement of how he used to consume life his mouth was actually nauseous with the flies and spiders which he had eaten just before mrs harker entered the room van helsing smiled in turn good he said your memory is true friend john i should have remembered and yet it is this very obliquity of thought and memory which makes mental disease such a fascinating study perhaps i may gain more knowledge out of the folly of this madman than i shall from the teaching of the most wise who knows i went on with my work and before long was through that in hand it seemed that the time had been very short indeed but there was van helsing back in the study do i interrupt he asked politely as he stood at the door not at all i answered come in my work is finished and i am free i can go with you now if you like it is needless i have seen him well i fear that he does not appraise me at much our interview was short when i entered his room he was sitting on a stool in the centre with his elbows on his knees and his face was the picture of sullen discontent i spoke to him as cheerfully as i could and with such a measure of respect as i could assume he made no reply whatever don t you know me i asked his answer was not reassuring i know you well enough you are the old fool van helsing i wish you would take yourself and your idiotic brain theories somewhere else damn all thick headed dutchmen not a word more would he say but sat in his implacable sullenness as indifferent to me as though i had not been in the room at all thus departed for this time my chance of much learning from this so clever lunatic so i shall go if i may and cheer myself with a few happy words with that sweet soul madam mina friend john it does rejoice me unspeakable that she is no more to be pained no more to be worried with our terrible things though we shall much miss her help it is better so i agree with you with all my heart i answered earnestly for i did not want him to weaken in this matter mrs harker is better out of it things are quite bad enough for us all men of the world and who have been in many tight places in our time but it is no place for a woman and if she had remained in touch with the affair it would in time infallibly have wrecked her so van helsing has gone to confer with mrs harker and harker quincey and art are all out following up the clues as to the earth boxes i shall finish my round of work and we shall meet to night mina harker s journal october it is strange to me to be kept in the dark as i am to day after jonathan s full confidence for so many years to see him manifestly avoid certain matters and those the most vital of all this morning i slept late after the fatigues of yesterday and though jonathan was late too he was the earlier he spoke to me before he went out never more sweetly or tenderly but he never mentioned a word of what had happened in the visit to the count s house and yet he must have known how terribly anxious i was poor dear fellow i suppose it must have distressed him even more than it did me they all agreed that it was best that i should not be drawn further into this awful work and i acquiesced but to think that he keeps anything from me and now i am crying like a silly fool when i know it comes from my husband s great love and from the good good wishes of those other strong men that has done me good well some day jonathan will tell me all and lest it should ever be that he should think for a moment that i kept anything from him i still keep my journal as usual then if he has feared of my trust i shall show it to him with every thought of my heart put down for his dear eyes to read i feel strangely sad and low spirited to day i suppose it is the reaction from the terrible excitement last night i went to bed when the men had gone simply because they told me to i didn t feel sleepy and i did feel full of devouring anxiety i kept thinking over everything that has been ever since jonathan came to see me in london and it all seems like a horrible tragedy with fate pressing on relentlessly to some destined end everything that one does seems no matter how right it may be to bring on the very thing which is most to be deplored if i hadn t gone to whitby perhaps poor dear lucy would be with us now she hadn t taken to visiting the churchyard till i came and if she hadn t come there in the day time with me she wouldn t have walked there in her sleep and if she hadn t gone there at night and asleep that monster couldn t have destroyed her as he did oh why did i ever go to whitby there now crying again i wonder what has come over me to day i must hide it from jonathan for if he knew that i had been crying twice in one morning i who never cried on my own account and whom he has never caused to shed a tear the dear fellow would fret his heart out i shall put a bold face on and if i do feel weepy he shall never see it i suppose it is one of the lessons that we poor women have to learn i can t quite remember how i fell asleep last night i remember hearing the sudden barking of the dogs and a lot of queer sounds like praying on a very tumultuous scale from mr renfield s room which is somewhere under this and then there was silence over everything silence so profound that it startled me and i got up and looked out of the window all was dark and silent the black shadows thrown by the moonlight seeming full of a silent mystery of their own not a thing seemed to be stirring but all to be grim and fixed as death or fate so that a thin streak of white mist that crept with almost imperceptible slowness across the grass towards the house seemed to have a sentience and a vitality of its own i think that the digression of my thoughts must have done me good for when i got back to bed i found a lethargy creeping over me i lay a while but could not quite sleep so i got out and looked out of the window again the mist was spreading and was now close up to the house so that i could see it lying thick against the wall as though it were stealing up to the windows the poor man was more loud than ever and though i could not distinguish a word he said i could in some way recognise in his tones some passionate entreaty on his part then there was the sound of a struggle and i knew that the attendants were dealing with him i was so frightened that i crept into bed and pulled the clothes over my head putting my fingers in my ears i was not then a bit sleepy at least so i thought but i must have fallen asleep for except dreams i do not remember anything until the morning when jonathan woke me i think that it took me an effort and a little time to realise where i was and that it was jonathan who was bending over me my dream was very peculiar and was almost typical of the way that waking thoughts become merged in or continued in dreams i thought that i was asleep and waiting for jonathan to come back i was very anxious about him and i was powerless to act my feet and my hands and my brain were weighted so that nothing could proceed at the usual pace and so i slept uneasily and thought then it began to dawn upon me that the air was heavy and dank and cold i put back the clothes from my face and found to my surprise that all was dim around the gaslight which i had left lit for jonathan but turned down came only like a tiny red spark through the fog which had evidently grown thicker and poured into the room then it occurred to me that i had shut the window before i had come to bed i would have got out to make certain on the point but some leaden lethargy seemed to chain my limbs and even my will i lay still and endured that was all i closed my eyes but could still see through my eyelids it is wonderful what tricks our dreams play us and how conveniently we can imagine the mist grew thicker and thicker and i could see now how it came in for i could see it like smoke or with the white energy of boiling water pouring in not through the window but through the joinings of the door it got thicker and thicker till it seemed as if it became concentrated into a sort of pillar of cloud in the room through the top of which i could see the light of the gas shining like a red eye things began to whirl through my brain just as the cloudy column was now whirling in the room and through it all came the scriptural words a pillar of cloud by day and of fire by night was it indeed some such spiritual guidance that was coming to me in my sleep but the pillar was composed of both the day and the night guiding for the fire was in the red eye which at the thought got a new fascination for me till as i looked the fire divided and seemed to shine on me through the fog like two red eyes such as lucy told me of in her momentary mental wandering when on the cliff the dying sunlight struck the windows of st mary s church suddenly the horror burst upon me that it was thus that jonathan had seen those awful women growing into reality through the whirling mist in the moonlight and in my dream i must have fainted for all became black darkness the last conscious effort which imagination made was to show me a livid white face bending over me out of the mist i must be careful of such dreams for they would unseat one s reason if there were too much of them i would get dr van helsing or dr seward to prescribe something for me which would make me sleep only that i fear to alarm them such a dream at the present time would become woven into their fears for me to night i shall strive hard to sleep naturally if i do not i shall to morrow night get them to give me a dose of chloral that cannot hurt me for once and it will give me a good night s sleep last night tired me more than if i had not slept at all october p m last night i slept but did not dream i must have slept soundly for i was not waked by jonathan coming to bed but the sleep has not refreshed me for to day i feel terribly weak and spiritless i spent all yesterday trying to read or lying down dozing in the afternoon mr renfield asked if he might see me poor man he was very gentle and when i came away he kissed my hand and bade god bless me some way it affected me much i am crying when i think of him this is a new weakness of which i must be careful jonathan would be miserable if he knew i had been crying he and the others were out till dinner time and they all came in tired i did what i could to brighten them up and i suppose that the effort did me good for i forgot how tired i was after dinner they sent me to bed and all went off to smoke together as they said but i knew that they wanted to tell each other of what had occurred to each during the day i could see from jonathan s manner that he had something important to communicate i was not so sleepy as i should have been so before they went i asked dr seward to give me a little opiate of some kind as i had not slept well the night before he very kindly made me up a sleeping draught which he gave to me telling me that it would do me no harm as it was very mild i have taken it and am waiting for sleep which still keeps aloof i hope i have not done wrong for as sleep begins to flirt with me a new fear comes that i may have been foolish in thus depriving myself of the power of waking i might want it here comes sleep good night chapter xx jonathan harker s journal october evening i found thomas snelling in his house at bethnal green but unhappily he was not in a condition to remember anything the very prospect of beer which my expected coming had opened to him had proved too much and he had begun too early on his expected debauch i learned however from his wife who seemed a decent poor soul that he was only the assistant to smollet who of the two mates was the responsible person so off i drove to walworth and found mr joseph smollet at home and in his shirtsleeves taking a late tea out of a saucer he is a decent intelligent fellow distinctly a good reliable type of workman and with a headpiece of his own he remembered all about the incident of the boxes and from a wonderful dog s eared notebook which he produced from some mysterious receptacle about the seat of his trousers and which had hieroglyphical entries in thick half obliterated pencil he gave me the destinations of the boxes there were he said six in the cartload which he took from carfax and left at chicksand street mile end new town and another six which he deposited at jamaica lane bermondsey if then the count meant to scatter these ghastly refuges of his over london these places were chosen as the first of delivery so that later he might distribute more fully the systematic manner in which this was done made me think that he could not mean to confine himself to two sides of london he was now fixed on the far east of the northern shore on the east of the southern shore and on the south the north and west were surely never meant to be left out of his diabolical scheme let alone the city itself and the very heart of fashionable london in the south west and west i went back to smollet and asked him if he could tell us if any other boxes had been taken from carfax he replied well guv nor you ve treated me wery an some i had given him half a sovereign an i ll tell yer all i know i heard a man by the name of bloxam say four nights ago in the are an ounds in pincher s alley as ow he an his mate ad ad a rare dusty job in a old ouse at purfect there ain t a many such jobs as this ere an i m thinkin that maybe sam bloxam could tell ye summut i asked if he could tell me where to find him i told him that if he could get me the address it would be worth another half sovereign to him so he gulped down the rest of his tea and stood up saying that he was going to begin the search then and there at the door he stopped and said look ere guv nor there ain t no sense in me a keepin you ere i may find sam soon or i mayn t but anyhow he ain t like to be in a way to tell ye much to night sam is a rare one when he starts on the booze if you can give me a envelope with a stamp on it and put yer address on it i ll find out where sam is to be found and post it ye to night but ye d better be up arter im soon in the mornin or maybe ye won t ketch im for sam gets off main early never mind the booze the night afore this was all practical so one of the children went off with a penny to buy an envelope and a sheet of paper and to keep the change when she came back i addressed the envelope and stamped it and when smollet had again faithfully promised to post the address when found i took my way to home we re on the track anyhow i am tired to night and want sleep mina is fast asleep and looks a little too pale her eyes look as though she had been crying poor dear i ve no doubt it frets her to be kept in the dark and it may make her doubly anxious about me and the others but it is best as it is it is better to be disappointed and worried in such a way now than to have her nerve broken the doctors were quite right to insist on her being kept out of this dreadful business i must be firm for on me this particular burden of silence must rest i shall not ever enter on the subject with her under any circumstances indeed it may not be a hard task after all for she herself has become reticent on the subject and has not spoken of the count or his doings ever since we told her of our decision october evening a long and trying and exciting day by the first post i got my directed envelope with a dirty scrap of paper enclosed on which was written with a carpenter s pencil in a sprawling hand sam bloxam korkrans poters cort bartel street walworth arsk for the depite i got the letter in bed and rose without waking mina she looked heavy and sleepy and pale and far from well i determined not to wake her but that when i should return from this new search i would arrange for her going back to exeter i think she would be happier in our own home with her daily tasks to interest her than in being here amongst us and in ignorance i only saw dr seward for a moment and told him where i was off to promising to come back and tell the rest so soon as i should have found out anything i drove to walworth and found with some difficulty potter s court mr smollet s spelling misled me as i asked for poter s court instead of potter s court however when i had found the court i had no difficulty in discovering corcoran s lodging house when i asked the man who came to the door for the depite he shook his head and said i dunno im there ain t no such a person ere i never eard of im in all my bloomin days don t believe there ain t nobody of that kind livin ere or anywheres i took out smollet s letter and as i read it it seemed to me that the lesson of the spelling of the name of the court might guide me what are you i asked i m the depity he answered i saw at once that i was on the right track phonetic spelling had again misled me a half crown tip put the deputy s knowledge at my disposal and i learned that mr bloxam who had slept off the remains of his beer on the previous night at corcoran s had left for his work at poplar at five o clock that morning he could not tell me where the place of work was situated but he had a vague idea that it was some kind of a new fangled ware us and with this slender clue i had to start for poplar it was twelve o clock before i got any satisfactory hint of such a building and this i got at a coffee shop where some workmen were having their dinner one of these suggested that there was being erected at cross angel street a new cold storage building and as this suited the condition of a new fangled ware us i at once drove to it an interview with a surly gatekeeper and a surlier foreman both of whom were appeased with the coin of the realm put me on the track of bloxam he was sent for on my suggesting that i was willing to pay his day s wages to his foreman for the privilege of asking him a few questions on a private matter he was a smart enough fellow though rough of speech and bearing when i had promised to pay for his information and given him an earnest he told me that he had made two journeys between carfax and a house in piccadilly and had taken from this house to the latter nine great boxes main heavy ones with a horse and cart hired by him for this purpose i asked him if he could tell me the number of the house in piccadilly to which he replied well guv nor i forgits the number but it was only a few doors from a big white church or somethink of the kind not long built it was a dusty old ouse too though nothin to the dustiness of the ouse we tooked the bloomin boxes from how did you get into the houses if they were both empty there was the old party what engaged me a waitin in the ouse at purfleet he elped me to lift the boxes and put them in the dray curse me but he was the strongest chap i ever struck an him a old feller with a white moustache one that thin you would think he couldn t throw a shadder how this phrase thrilled through me why e took up is end o the boxes like they was pounds of tea and me a puffin an a blowin afore i could up end mine anyhow an i m no chicken neither how did you get into the house in piccadilly i asked he was there too he must a started off and got there afore me for when i rung of the bell he kem an opened the door isself an elped me to carry the boxes into the all the whole nine i asked yus there was five in the first load an four in the second it was main dry work an i don t so well remember ow i got ome i interrupted him were the boxes left in the hall yus it was a big all an there was nothin else in it i made one more attempt to further matters you didn t have any key never used no key nor nothink the old gent he opened the door isself an shut it again when i druv off i don t remember the last time but that was the beer and you can t remember the number of the house no sir but ye needn t have no difficulty about that it s a igh un with a stone front with a bow on it an igh steps up to the door i know them steps avin ad to carry the boxes up with three loafers what come round to earn a copper the old gent give them shillin s an they seein they got so much they wanted more but e took one of them by the shoulder and was like to throw im down the steps till the lot of them went away cussin i thought that with this description i could find the house so having paid my friend for his information i started off for piccadilly i had gained a new painful experience the count could it was evident handle the earth boxes himself if so time was precious for now that he had achieved a certain amount of distribution he could by choosing his own time complete the task unobserved at piccadilly circus i discharged my cab and walked westward beyond the junior constitutional i came across the house described and was satisfied that this was the next of the lairs arranged by dracula the house looked as though it had been long untenanted the windows were encrusted with dust and the shutters were up all the framework was black with time and from the iron the paint had mostly scaled away it was evident that up to lately there had been a large notice board in front of the balcony it had however been roughly torn away the uprights which had supported it still remaining behind the rails of the balcony i saw there were some loose boards whose raw edges looked white i would have given a good deal to have been able to see the notice board intact as it would perhaps have given some clue to the ownership of the house i remembered my experience of the investigation and purchase of carfax and i could not but feel that if i could find the former owner there might be some means discovered of gaining access to the house there was at present nothing to be learned from the piccadilly side and nothing could be done so i went round to the back to see if anything could be gathered from this quarter the mews were active the piccadilly houses being mostly in occupation i asked one or two of the grooms and helpers whom i saw around if they could tell me anything about the empty house one of them said that he heard it had lately been taken but he couldn t say from whom he told me however that up to very lately there had been a notice board of for sale up and that perhaps mitchell sons candy the house agents could tell me something as he thought he remembered seeing the name of that firm on the board i did not wish to seem too eager or to let my informant know or guess too much so thanking him in the usual manner i strolled away it was now growing dusk and the autumn night was closing in so i did not lose any time having learned the address of mitchell sons candy from a directory at the berkeley i was soon at their office in sackville street the gentleman who saw me was particularly suave in manner but uncommunicative in equal proportion having once told me that the piccadilly house which throughout our interview he called a mansion was sold he considered my business as concluded when i asked who had purchased it he opened his eyes a thought wider and paused a few seconds before replying it is sold sir pardon me i said with equal politeness but i have a special reason for wishing to know who purchased it again he paused longer and raised his eyebrows still more it is sold sir was again his laconic reply surely i said you do not mind letting me know so much but i do mind he answered the affairs of their clients are absolutely safe in the hands of mitchell sons candy this was manifestly a prig of the first water and there was no use arguing with him i thought i had best meet him on his own ground so i said your clients sir are happy in having so resolute a guardian of their confidence i am myself a professional man here i handed him my card in this instance i am not prompted by curiosity i act on the part of lord godalming who wishes to know something of the property which was he understood lately for sale these words put a different complexion on affairs he said i would like to oblige you if i could mr harker and especially would i like to oblige his lordship we once carried out a small matter of renting some chambers for him when he was the honourable arthur holmwood if you will let me have his lordship s address i will consult the house on the subject and will in any case communicate with his lordship by to night s post it will be a pleasure if we can so far deviate from our rules as to give the required information to his lordship i wanted to secure a friend and not to make an enemy so i thanked him gave the address at dr seward s and came away it was now dark and i was tired and hungry i got a cup of tea at the a rated bread company and came down to purfleet by the next train i found all the others at home mina was looking tired and pale but she made a gallant effort to be bright and cheerful it wrung my heart to think that i had had to keep anything from her and so caused her inquietude thank god this will be the last night of her looking on at our conferences and feeling the sting of our not showing our confidence it took all my courage to hold to the wise resolution of keeping her out of our grim task she seems somehow more reconciled or else the very subject seems to have become repugnant to her for when any accidental allusion is made she actually shudders i am glad we made our resolution in time as with such a feeling as this our growing knowledge would be torture to her i could not tell the others of the day s discovery till we were alone so after dinner followed by a little music to save appearances even amongst ourselves i took mina to her room and left her to go to bed the dear girl was more affectionate with me than ever and clung to me as though she would detain me but there was much to be talked of and i came away thank god the ceasing of telling things has made no difference between us when i came down again i found the others all gathered round the fire in the study in the train i had written my diary so far and simply read it off to them as the best means of letting them get abreast of my own information when i had finished van helsing said this has been a great day s work friend jonathan doubtless we are on the track of the missing boxes if we find them all in that house then our work is near the end but if there be some missing we must search until we find them then shall we make our final coup and hunt the wretch to his real death we all sat silent awhile and all at once mr morris spoke say how are we going to get into that house we got into the other answered lord godalming quickly but art this is different we broke house at carfax but we had night and a walled park to protect us it will be a mighty different thing to commit burglary in piccadilly either by day or night i confess i don t see how we are going to get in unless that agency duck can find us a key of some sort perhaps we shall know when you get his letter in the morning lord godalming s brows contracted and he stood up and walked about the room by and by he stopped and said turning from one to another of us quincey s head is level this burglary business is getting serious we got off once all right but we have now a rare job on hand unless we can find the count s key basket as nothing could well be done before morning and as it would be at least advisable to wait till lord godalming should hear from mitchell s we decided not to take any active step before breakfast time for a good while we sat and smoked discussing the matter in its various lights and bearings i took the opportunity of bringing this diary right up to the moment i am very sleepy and shall go to bed just a line mina sleeps soundly and her breathing is regular her forehead is puckered up into little wrinkles as though she thinks even in her sleep she is still too pale but does not look so haggard as she did this morning to morrow will i hope mend all this she will be herself at home in exeter oh but i am sleepy dr seward s diary october i am puzzled afresh about renfield his moods change so rapidly that i find it difficult to keep touch of them and as they always mean something more than his own well being they form a more than interesting study this morning when i went to see him after his repulse of van helsing his manner was that of a man commanding destiny he was in fact commanding destiny subjectively he did not really care for any of the things of mere earth he was in the clouds and looked down on all the weaknesses and wants of us poor mortals i thought i would improve the occasion and learn something so i asked him what about the flies these times he smiled on me in quite a superior sort of way such a smile as would have become the face of malvolio as he answered me the fly my dear sir has one striking feature its wings are typical of the a rial powers of the psychic faculties the ancients did well when they typified the soul as a butterfly i thought i would push his analogy to its utmost logically so i said quickly oh it is a soul you are after now is it his madness foiled his reason and a puzzled look spread over his face as shaking his head with a decision which i had but seldom seen in him he said oh no oh no i want no souls life is all i want here he brightened up i am pretty indifferent about it at present life is all right i have all i want you must get a new patient doctor if you wish to study zo phagy this puzzled me a little so i drew him on then you command life you are a god i suppose he smiled with an ineffably benign superiority oh no far be it from me to arrogate to myself the attributes of the deity i am not even concerned in his especially spiritual doings if i may state my intellectual position i am so far as concerns things purely terrestrial somewhat in the position which enoch occupied spiritually this was a poser to me i could not at the moment recall enoch s appositeness so i had to ask a simple question though i felt that by so doing i was lowering myself in the eyes of the lunatic and why with enoch because he walked with god i could not see the analogy but did not like to admit it so i harked back to what he had denied so you don t care about life and you don t want souls why not i put my question quickly and somewhat sternly on purpose to disconcert him the effort succeeded for an instant he unconsciously relapsed into his old servile manner bent low before me and actually fawned upon me as he replied i don t want any souls indeed indeed i don t i couldn t use them if i had them they would be no manner of use to me i couldn t eat them or he suddenly stopped and the old cunning look spread over his face like a wind sweep on the surface of the water and doctor as to life what is it after all when you ve got all you require and you know that you will never want that is all i have friends good friends like you dr seward this was said with a leer of inexpressible cunning i know that i shall never lack the means of life i think that through the cloudiness of his insanity he saw some antagonism in me for he at once fell back on the last refuge of such as he a dogged silence after a short time i saw that for the present it was useless to speak to him he was sulky and so i came away later in the day he sent for me ordinarily i would not have come without special reason but just at present i am so interested in him that i would gladly make an effort besides i am glad to have anything to help to pass the time harker is out following up clues and so are lord godalming and quincey van helsing sits in my study poring over the record prepared by the harkers he seems to think that by accurate knowledge of all details he will light upon some clue he does not wish to be disturbed in the work without cause i would have taken him with me to see the patient only i thought that after his last repulse he might not care to go again there was also another reason renfield might not speak so freely before a third person as when he and i were alone i found him sitting out in the middle of the floor on his stool a pose which is generally indicative of some mental energy on his part when i came in he said at once as though the question had been waiting on his lips what about souls it was evident then that my surmise had been correct unconscious cerebration was doing its work even with the lunatic i determined to have the matter out what about them yourself i asked he did not reply for a moment but looked all round him and up and down as though he expected to find some inspiration for an answer i don t want any souls he said in a feeble apologetic way the matter seemed preying on his mind and so i determined to use it to be cruel only to be kind so i said you like life and you want life oh yes but that is all right you needn t worry about that but i asked how are we to get the life without getting the soul also this seemed to puzzle him so i followed it up a nice time you ll have some time when you re flying out there with the souls of thousands of flies and spiders and birds and cats buzzing and twittering and miauing all round you you ve got their lives you know and you must put up with their souls something seemed to affect his imagination for he put his fingers to his ears and shut his eyes screwing them up tightly just as a small boy does when his face is being soaped there was something pathetic in it that touched me it also gave me a lesson for it seemed that before me was a child only a child though the features were worn and the stubble on the jaws was white it was evident that he was undergoing some process of mental disturbance and knowing how his past moods had interpreted things seemingly foreign to himself i thought i would enter into his mind as well as i could and go with him the first step was to restore confidence so i asked him speaking pretty loud so that he would hear me through his closed ears would you like some sugar to get your flies round again he seemed to wake up all at once and shook his head with a laugh he replied not much flies are poor things after all after a pause he added but i don t want their souls buzzing round me all the same or spiders i went on blow spiders what s the use of spiders there isn t anything in them to eat or he stopped suddenly as though reminded of a forbidden topic so so i thought to myself this is the second time he has suddenly stopped at the word drink what does it mean renfield seemed himself aware of having made a lapse for he hurried on as though to distract my attention from it i don t take any stock at all in such matters rats and mice and such small deer as shakespeare has it chicken feed of the larder they might be called i m past all that sort of nonsense you might as well ask a man to eat molecules with a pair of chop sticks as to try to interest me about the lesser carnivora when i know of what is before me i see i said you want big things that you can make your teeth meet in how would you like to breakfast on elephant what ridiculous nonsense you are talking he was getting too wide awake so i thought i would press him hard i wonder i said reflectively what an elephant s soul is like the effect i desired was obtained for he at once fell from his high horse and became a child again i don t want an elephant s soul or any soul at all he said for a few moments he sat despondently suddenly he jumped to his feet with his eyes blazing and all the signs of intense cerebral excitement to hell with you and your souls he shouted why do you plague me about souls haven t i got enough to worry and pain and distract me already without thinking of souls he looked so hostile that i thought he was in for another homicidal fit so i blew my whistle the instant however that i did so he became calm and said apologetically forgive me doctor i forgot myself you do not need any help i am so worried in my mind that i am apt to be irritable if you only knew the problem i have to face and that i am working out you would pity and tolerate and pardon me pray do not put me in a strait waistcoat i want to think and i cannot think freely when my body is confined i am sure you will understand he had evidently self control so when the attendants came i told them not to mind and they withdrew renfield watched them go when the door was closed he said with considerable dignity and sweetness dr seward you have been very considerate towards me believe me that i am very very grateful to you i thought it well to leave him in this mood and so i came away there is certainly something to ponder over in this man s state several points seem to make what the american interviewer calls a story if one could only get them in proper order here they are will not mention drinking fears the thought of being burdened with the soul of anything has no dread of wanting life in the future despises the meaner forms of life altogether though he dreads being haunted by their souls logically all these things point one way he has assurance of some kind that he will acquire some higher life he dreads the consequence the burden of a soul then it is a human life he looks to and the assurance merciful god the count has been to him and there is some new scheme of terror afoot later i went after my round to van helsing and told him my suspicion he grew very grave and after thinking the matter over for a while asked me to take him to renfield i did so as we came to the door we heard the lunatic within singing gaily as he used to do in the time which now seems so long ago when we entered we saw with amazement that he had spread out his sugar as of old the flies lethargic with the autumn were beginning to buzz into the room we tried to make him talk of the subject of our previous conversation but he would not attend he went on with his singing just as though we had not been present he had got a scrap of paper and was folding it into a note book we had to come away as ignorant as we went in his is a curious case indeed we must watch him to night letter mitchell sons and candy to lord godalming october my lord we are at all times only too happy to meet your wishes we beg with regard to the desire of your lordship expressed by mr harker on your behalf to supply the following information concerning the sale and purchase of no piccadilly the original vendors are the executors of the late mr archibald winter suffield the purchaser is a foreign nobleman count de ville who effected the purchase himself paying the purchase money in notes over the counter if your lordship will pardon us using so vulgar an expression beyond this we know nothing whatever of him we are my lord your lordship s humble servants mitchell sons candy dr seward s diary october i placed a man in the corridor last night and told him to make an accurate note of any sound he might hear from renfield s room and gave him instructions that if there should be anything strange he was to call me after dinner when we had all gathered round the fire in the study mrs harker having gone to bed we discussed the attempts and discoveries of the day harker was the only one who had any result and we are in great hopes that his clue may be an important one before going to bed i went round to the patient s room and looked in through the observation trap he was sleeping soundly and his heart rose and fell with regular respiration this morning the man on duty reported to me that a little after midnight he was restless and kept saying his prayers somewhat loudly i asked him if that was all he replied that it was all he heard there was something about his manner so suspicious that i asked him point blank if he had been asleep he denied sleep but admitted to having dozed for a while it is too bad that men cannot be trusted unless they are watched to day harker is out following up his clue and art and quincey are looking after horses godalming thinks that it will be well to have horses always in readiness for when we get the information which we seek there will be no time to lose we must sterilise all the imported earth between sunrise and sunset we shall thus catch the count at his weakest and without a refuge to fly to van helsing is off to the british museum looking up some authorities on ancient medicine the old physicians took account of things which their followers do not accept and the professor is searching for witch and demon cures which may be useful to us later i sometimes think we must be all mad and that we shall wake to sanity in strait waistcoats later we have met again we seem at last to be on the track and our work of to morrow may be the beginning of the end i wonder if renfield s quiet has anything to do with this his moods have so followed the doings of the count that the coming destruction of the monster may be carried to him in some subtle way if we could only get some hint as to what passed in his mind between the time of my argument with him to day and his resumption of fly catching it might afford us a valuable clue he is now seemingly quiet for a spell is he that wild yell seemed to come from his room the attendant came bursting into my room and told me that renfield had somehow met with some accident he had heard him yell and when he went to him found him lying on his face on the floor all covered with blood i must go at once chapter xxi dr seward s diary october let me put down with exactness all that happened as well as i can remember it since last i made an entry not a detail that i can recall must be forgotten in all calmness i must proceed when i came to renfield s room i found him lying on the floor on his left side in a glittering pool of blood when i went to move him it became at once apparent that he had received some terrible injuries there seemed none of that unity of purpose between the parts of the body which marks even lethargic sanity as the face was exposed i could see that it was horribly bruised as though it had been beaten against the floor indeed it was from the face wounds that the pool of blood originated the attendant who was kneeling beside the body said to me as we turned him over i think sir his back is broken see both his right arm and leg and the whole side of his face are paralysed how such a thing could have happened puzzled the attendant beyond measure he seemed quite bewildered and his brows were gathered in as he said i can t understand the two things he could mark his face like that by beating his own head on the floor i saw a young woman do it once at the eversfield asylum before anyone could lay hands on her and i suppose he might have broke his neck by falling out of bed if he got in an awkward kink but for the life of me i can t imagine how the two things occurred if his back was broke he couldn t beat his head and if his face was like that before the fall out of bed there would be marks of it i said to him go to dr van helsing and ask him to kindly come here at once i want him without an instant s delay the man ran off and within a few minutes the professor in his dressing gown and slippers appeared when he saw renfield on the ground he looked keenly at him a moment and then turned to me i think he recognised my thought in my eyes for he said very quietly manifestly for the ears of the attendant ah a sad accident he will need very careful watching and much attention i shall stay with you myself but i shall first dress myself if you will remain i shall in a few minutes join you the patient was now breathing stertorously and it was easy to see that he had suffered some terrible injury van helsing returned with extraordinary celerity bearing with him a surgical case he had evidently been thinking and had his mind made up for almost before he looked at the patient he whispered to me send the attendant away we must be alone with him when he becomes conscious after the operation so i said i think that will do now simmons we have done all that we can at present you had better go your round and dr van helsing will operate let me know instantly if there be anything unusual anywhere the man withdrew and we went into a strict examination of the patient the wounds of the face was superficial the real injury was a depressed fracture of the skull extending right up through the motor area the professor thought a moment and said we must reduce the pressure and get back to normal conditions as far as can be the rapidity of the suffusion shows the terrible nature of his injury the whole motor area seems affected the suffusion of the brain will increase quickly so we must trephine at once or it may be too late as he was speaking there was a soft tapping at the door i went over and opened it and found in the corridor without arthur and quincey in pajamas and slippers the former spoke i heard your man call up dr van helsing and tell him of an accident so i woke quincey or rather called for him as he was not asleep things are moving too quickly and too strangely for sound sleep for any of us these times i ve been thinking that to morrow night will not see things as they have been we ll have to look back and forward a little more than we have done may we come in i nodded and held the door open till they had entered then i closed it again when quincey saw the attitude and state of the patient and noted the horrible pool on the floor he said softly my god what has happened to him poor poor devil i told him briefly and added that we expected he would recover consciousness after the operation for a short time at all events he went at once and sat down on the edge of the bed with godalming beside him we all watched in patience we shall wait said van helsing just long enough to fix the best spot for trephining so that we may most quickly and perfectly remove the blood clot for it is evident that the h morrhage is increasing the minutes during which we waited passed with fearful slowness i had a horrible sinking in my heart and from van helsing s face i gathered that he felt some fear or apprehension as to what was to come i dreaded the words that renfield might speak i was positively afraid to think but the conviction of what was coming was on me as i have read of men who have heard the death watch the poor man s breathing came in uncertain gasps each instant he seemed as though he would open his eyes and speak but then would follow a prolonged stertorous breath and he would relapse into a more fixed insensibility inured as i was to sick beds and death this suspense grew and grew upon me i could almost hear the beating of my own heart and the blood surging through my temples sounded like blows from a hammer the silence finally became agonising i looked at my companions one after another and saw from their flushed faces and damp brows that they were enduring equal torture there was a nervous suspense over us all as though overhead some dread bell would peal out powerfully when we should least expect it at last there came a time when it was evident that the patient was sinking fast he might die at any moment i looked up at the professor and caught his eyes fixed on mine his face was sternly set as he spoke there is no time to lose his words may be worth many lives i have been thinking so as i stood here it may be there is a soul at stake we shall operate just above the ear without another word he made the operation for a few moments the breathing continued to be stertorous then there came a breath so prolonged that it seemed as though it would tear open his chest suddenly his eyes opened and became fixed in a wild helpless stare this was continued for a few moments then it softened into a glad surprise and from the lips came a sigh of relief he moved convulsively and as he did so said i ll be quiet doctor tell them to take off the strait waistcoat i have had a terrible dream and it has left me so weak that i cannot move what s wrong with my face it feels all swollen and it smarts dreadfully he tried to turn his head but even with the effort his eyes seemed to grow glassy again so i gently put it back then van helsing said in a quiet grave tone tell us your dream mr renfield as he heard the voice his face brightened through its mutilation and he said that is dr van helsing how good it is of you to be here give me some water my lips are dry and i shall try to tell you i dreamed he stopped and seemed fainting i called quietly to quincey the brandy it is in my study quick he flew and returned with a glass the decanter of brandy and a carafe of water we moistened the parched lips and the patient quickly revived it seemed however that his poor injured brain had been working in the interval for when he was quite conscious he looked at me piercingly with an agonised confusion which i shall never forget and said i must not deceive myself it was no dream but all a grim reality then his eyes roved round the room as they caught sight of the two figures sitting patiently on the edge of the bed he went on if i were not sure already i would know from them for an instant his eyes closed not with pain or sleep but voluntarily as though he were bringing all his faculties to bear when he opened them he said hurriedly and with more energy than he had yet displayed quick doctor quick i am dying i feel that i have but a few minutes and then i must go back to death or worse wet my lips with brandy again i have something that i must say before i die or before my poor crushed brain dies anyhow thank you it was that night after you left me when i implored you to let me go away i couldn t speak then for i felt my tongue was tied but i was as sane then except in that way as i am now i was in an agony of despair for a long time after you left me it seemed hours then there came a sudden peace to me my brain seemed to become cool again and i realised where i was i heard the dogs bark behind our house but not where he was as he spoke van helsing s eyes never blinked but his hand came out and met mine and gripped it hard he did not however betray himself he nodded slightly and said go on in a low voice renfield proceeded he came up to the window in the mist as i had seen him often before but he was solid then not a ghost and his eyes were fierce like a man s when angry he was laughing with his red mouth the sharp white teeth glinted in the moonlight when he turned to look back over the belt of trees to where the dogs were barking i wouldn t ask him to come in at first though i knew he wanted to just as he had wanted all along then he began promising me things not in words but by doing them he was interrupted by a word from the professor how by making them happen just as he used to send in the flies when the sun was shining great big fat ones with steel and sapphire on their wings and big moths in the night with skull and cross bones on their backs van helsing nodded to him as he whispered to me unconsciously the acherontia aitetropos of the sphinges what you call the death s head moth the patient went on without stopping then he began to whisper rats rats rats hundreds thousands millions of them and every one a life and dogs to eat them and cats too all lives all red blood with years of life in it and not merely buzzing flies i laughed at him for i wanted to see what he could do then the dogs howled away beyond the dark trees in his house he beckoned me to the window i got up and looked out and he raised his hands and seemed to call out without using any words a dark mass spread over the grass coming on like the shape of a flame of fire and then he moved the mist to the right and left and i could see that there were thousands of rats with their eyes blazing red like his only smaller he held up his hand and they all stopped and i thought he seemed to be saying all these lives will i give you ay and many more and greater through countless ages if you will fall down and worship me and then a red cloud like the colour of blood seemed to close over my eyes and before i knew what i was doing i found myself opening the sash and saying to him come in lord and master the rats were all gone but he slid into the room through the sash though it was only open an inch wide just as the moon herself has often come in through the tiniest crack and has stood before me in all her size and splendour his voice was weaker so i moistened his lips with the brandy again and he continued but it seemed as though his memory had gone on working in the interval for his story was further advanced i was about to call him back to the point but van helsing whispered to me let him go on do not interrupt him he cannot go back and maybe could not proceed at all if once he lost the thread of his thought he proceeded all day i waited to hear from him but he did not send me anything not even a blow fly and when the moon got up i was pretty angry with him when he slid in through the window though it was shut and did not even knock i got mad with him he sneered at me and his white face looked out of the mist with his red eyes gleaming and he went on as though he owned the whole place and i was no one he didn t even smell the same as he went by me i couldn t hold him i thought that somehow mrs harker had come into the room the two men sitting on the bed stood up and came over standing behind him so that he could not see them but where they could hear better they were both silent but the professor started and quivered his face however grew grimmer and sterner still renfield went on without noticing when mrs harker came in to see me this afternoon she wasn t the same it was like tea after the teapot had been watered here we all moved but no one said a word he went on i didn t know that she was here till she spoke and she didn t look the same i don t care for the pale people i like them with lots of blood in them and hers had all seemed to have run out i didn t think of it at the time but when she went away i began to think and it made me mad to know that he had been taking the life out of her i could feel that the rest quivered as i did but we remained otherwise still so when he came to night i was ready for him i saw the mist stealing in and i grabbed it tight i had heard that madmen have unnatural strength and as i knew i was a madman at times anyhow i resolved to use my power ay and he felt it too for he had to come out of the mist to struggle with me i held tight and i thought i was going to win for i didn t mean him to take any more of her life till i saw his eyes they burned into me and my strength became like water he slipped through it and when i tried to cling to him he raised me up and flung me down there was a red cloud before me and a noise like thunder and the mist seemed to steal away under the door his voice was becoming fainter and his breath more stertorous van helsing stood up instinctively we know the worst now he said he is here and we know his purpose it may not be too late let us be armed the same as we were the other night but lose no time there is not an instant to spare there was no need to put our fear nay our conviction into words we shared them in common we all hurried and took from our rooms the same things that we had when we entered the count s house the professor had his ready and as we met in the corridor he pointed to them significantly as he said they never leave me and they shall not till this unhappy business is over be wise also my friends it is no common enemy that we deal with alas alas that that dear madam mina should suffer he stopped his voice was breaking and i do not know if rage or terror predominated in my own heart outside the harkers door we paused art and quincey held back and the latter said should we disturb her we must said van helsing grimly if the door be locked i shall break it in may it not frighten her terribly it is unusual to break into a lady s room van helsing said solemnly you are always right but this is life and death all chambers are alike to the doctor and even were they not they are all as one to me to night friend john when i turn the handle if the door does not open do you put your shoulder down and shove and you too my friends now he turned the handle as he spoke but the door did not yield we threw ourselves against it with a crash it burst open and we almost fell headlong into the room the professor did actually fall and i saw across him as he gathered himself up from hands and knees what i saw appalled me i felt my hair rise like bristles on the back of my neck and my heart seemed to stand still the moonlight was so bright that through the thick yellow blind the room was light enough to see on the bed beside the window lay jonathan harker his face flushed and breathing heavily as though in a stupor kneeling on the near edge of the bed facing outwards was the white clad figure of his wife by her side stood a tall thin man clad in black his face was turned from us but the instant we saw we all recognised the count in every way even to the scar on his forehead with his left hand he held both mrs harker s hands keeping them away with her arms at full tension his right hand gripped her by the back of the neck forcing her face down on his bosom her white nightdress was smeared with blood and a thin stream trickled down the man s bare breast which was shown by his torn open dress the attitude of the two had a terrible resemblance to a child forcing a kitten s nose into a saucer of milk to compel it to drink as we burst into the room the count turned his face and the hellish look that i had heard described seemed to leap into it his eyes flamed red with devilish passion the great nostrils of the white aquiline nose opened wide and quivered at the edge and the white sharp teeth behind the full lips of the blood dripping mouth champed together like those of a wild beast with a wrench which threw his victim back upon the bed as though hurled from a height he turned and sprang at us but by this time the professor had gained his feet and was holding towards him the envelope which contained the sacred wafer the count suddenly stopped just as poor lucy had done outside the tomb and cowered back further and further back he cowered as we lifting our crucifixes advanced the moonlight suddenly failed as a great black cloud sailed across the sky and when the gaslight sprang up under quincey s match we saw nothing but a faint vapour this as we looked trailed under the door which with the recoil from its bursting open had swung back to its old position van helsing art and i moved forward to mrs harker who by this time had drawn her breath and with it had given a scream so wild so ear piercing so despairing that it seems to me now that it will ring in my ears till my dying day for a few seconds she lay in her helpless attitude and disarray her face was ghastly with a pallor which was accentuated by the blood which smeared her lips and cheeks and chin from her throat trickled a thin stream of blood her eyes were mad with terror then she put before her face her poor crushed hands which bore on their whiteness the red mark of the count s terrible grip and from behind them came a low desolate wail which made the terrible scream seem only the quick expression of an endless grief van helsing stepped forward and drew the coverlet gently over her body whilst art after looking at her face for an instant despairingly ran out of the room van helsing whispered to me jonathan is in a stupor such as we know the vampire can produce we can do nothing with poor madam mina for a few moments till she recovers herself i must wake him he dipped the end of a towel in cold water and with it began to flick him on the face his wife all the while holding her face between her hands and sobbing in a way that was heart breaking to hear i raised the blind and looked out of the window there was much moonshine and as i looked i could see quincey morris run across the lawn and hide himself in the shadow of a great yew tree it puzzled me to think why he was doing this but at the instant i heard harker s quick exclamation as he woke to partial consciousness and turned to the bed on his face as there might well be was a look of wild amazement he seemed dazed for a few seconds and then full consciousness seemed to burst upon him all at once and he started up his wife was aroused by the quick movement and turned to him with her arms stretched out as though to embrace him instantly however she drew them in again and putting her elbows together held her hands before her face and shuddered till the bed beneath her shook in god s name what does this mean harker cried out dr seward dr van helsing what is it what has happened what is wrong mina dear what is it what does that blood mean my god my god has it come to this and raising himself to his knees he beat his hands wildly together good god help us help her oh help her with a quick movement he jumped from bed and began to pull on his clothes all the man in him awake at the need for instant exertion what has happened tell me all about it he cried without pausing dr van helsing you love mina i know oh do something to save her it cannot have gone too far yet guard her while i look for him his wife through her terror and horror and distress saw some sure danger to him instantly forgetting her own grief she seized hold of him and cried out no no jonathan you must not leave me i have suffered enough to night god knows without the dread of his harming you you must stay with me stay with these friends who will watch over you her expression became frantic as she spoke and he yielding to her she pulled him down sitting on the bed side and clung to him fiercely van helsing and i tried to calm them both the professor held up his little golden crucifix and said with wonderful calmness do not fear my dear we are here and whilst this is close to you no foul thing can approach you are safe for to night and we must be calm and take counsel together she shuddered and was silent holding down her head on her husband s breast when she raised it his white night robe was stained with blood where her lips had touched and where the thin open wound in her neck had sent forth drops the instant she saw it she drew back with a low wail and whispered amidst choking sobs unclean unclean i must touch him or kiss him no more oh that it should be that it is i who am now his worst enemy and whom he may have most cause to fear to this he spoke out resolutely nonsense mina it is a shame to me to hear such a word i would not hear it of you and i shall not hear it from you may god judge me by my deserts and punish me with more bitter suffering than even this hour if by any act or will of mine anything ever come between us he put out his arms and folded her to his breast and for a while she lay there sobbing he looked at us over her bowed head with eyes that blinked damply above his quivering nostrils his mouth was set as steel after a while her sobs became less frequent and more faint and then he said to me speaking with a studied calmness which i felt tried his nervous power to the utmost and now dr seward tell me all about it too well i know the broad fact tell me all that has been i told him exactly what had happened and he listened with seeming impassiveness but his nostrils twitched and his eyes blazed as i told how the ruthless hands of the count had held his wife in that terrible and horrid position with her mouth to the open wound in his breast it interested me even at that moment to see that whilst the face of white set passion worked convulsively over the bowed head the hands tenderly and lovingly stroked the ruffled hair just as i had finished quincey and godalming knocked at the door they entered in obedience to our summons van helsing looked at me questioningly i understood him to mean if we were to take advantage of their coming to divert if possible the thoughts of the unhappy husband and wife from each other and from themselves so on nodding acquiescence to him he asked them what they had seen or done to which lord godalming answered i could not see him anywhere in the passage or in any of our rooms i looked in the study but though he had been there he had gone he had however he stopped suddenly looking at the poor drooping figure on the bed van helsing said gravely go on friend arthur we want here no more concealments our hope now is in knowing all tell freely so art went on he had been there and though it could only have been for a few seconds he made rare hay of the place all the manuscript had been burned and the blue flames were flickering amongst the white ashes the cylinders of your phonograph too were thrown on the fire and the wax had helped the flames here i interrupted thank god there is the other copy in the safe his face lit for a moment but fell again as he went on i ran downstairs then but could see no sign of him i looked into renfield s room but there was no trace there except again he paused go on said harker hoarsely so he bowed his head and moistening his lips with his tongue added except that the poor fellow is dead mrs harker raised her head looking from one to the other of us she said solemnly god s will be done i could not but feel that art was keeping back something but as i took it that it was with a purpose i said nothing van helsing turned to morris and asked and you friend quincey have you any to tell a little he answered it may be much eventually but at present i can t say i thought it well to know if possible where the count would go when he left the house i did not see him but i saw a bat rise from renfield s window and flap westward i expected to see him in some shape go back to carfax but he evidently sought some other lair he will not be back to night for the sky is reddening in the east and the dawn is close we must work to morrow he said the latter words through his shut teeth for a space of perhaps a couple of minutes there was silence and i could fancy that i could hear the sound of our hearts beating then van helsing said placing his hand very tenderly on mrs harker s head and now madam mina poor dear dear madam mina tell us exactly what happened god knows that i do not want that you be pained but it is need that we know all for now more than ever has all work to be done quick and sharp and in deadly earnest the day is close to us that must end all if it may be so and now is the chance that we may live and learn the poor dear lady shivered and i could see the tension of her nerves as she clasped her husband closer to her and bent her head lower and lower still on his breast then she raised her head proudly and held out one hand to van helsing who took it in his and after stooping and kissing it reverently held it fast the other hand was locked in that of her husband who held his other arm thrown round her protectingly after a pause in which she was evidently ordering her thoughts she began i took the sleeping draught which you had so kindly given me but for a long time it did not act i seemed to become more wakeful and myriads of horrible fancies began to crowd in upon my mind all of them connected with death and vampires with blood and pain and trouble her husband involuntarily groaned as she turned to him and said lovingly do not fret dear you must be brave and strong and help me through the horrible task if you only knew what an effort it is to me to tell of this fearful thing at all you would understand how much i need your help well i saw i must try to help the medicine to its work with my will if it was to do me any good so i resolutely set myself to sleep sure enough sleep must soon have come to me for i remember no more jonathan coming in had not waked me for he lay by my side when next i remember there was in the room the same thin white mist that i had before noticed but i forget now if you know of this you will find it in my diary which i shall show you later i felt the same vague terror which had come to me before and the same sense of some presence i turned to wake jonathan but found that he slept so soundly that it seemed as if it was he who had taken the sleeping draught and not i i tried but i could not wake him this caused me a great fear and i looked around terrified then indeed my heart sank within me beside the bed as if he had stepped out of the mist or rather as if the mist had turned into his figure for it had entirely disappeared stood a tall thin man all in black i knew him at once from the description of the others the waxen face the high aquiline nose on which the light fell in a thin white line the parted red lips with the sharp white teeth showing between and the red eyes that i had seemed to see in the sunset on the windows of st mary s church at whitby i knew too the red scar on his forehead where jonathan had struck him for an instant my heart stood still and i would have screamed out only that i was paralysed in the pause he spoke in a sort of keen cutting whisper pointing as he spoke to jonathan silence if you make a sound i shall take him and dash his brains out before your very eyes i was appalled and was too bewildered to do or say anything with a mocking smile he placed one hand upon my shoulder and holding me tight bared my throat with the other saying as he did so first a little refreshment to reward my exertions you may as well be quiet it is not the first time or the second that your veins have appeased my thirst i was bewildered and strangely enough i did not want to hinder him i suppose it is a part of the horrible curse that such is when his touch is on his victim and oh my god my god pity me he placed his reeking lips upon my throat her husband groaned again she clasped his hand harder and looked at him pityingly as if he were the injured one and went on i felt my strength fading away and i was in a half swoon how long this horrible thing lasted i know not but it seemed that a long time must have passed before he took his foul awful sneering mouth away i saw it drip with the fresh blood the remembrance seemed for a while to overpower her and she drooped and would have sunk down but for her husband s sustaining arm with a great effort she recovered herself and went on then he spoke to me mockingly and so you like the others would play your brains against mine you would help these men to hunt me and frustrate me in my designs you know now and they know in part already and will know in full before long what it is to cross my path they should have kept their energies for use closer to home whilst they played wits against me against me who commanded nations and intrigued for them and fought for them hundreds of years before they were born i was countermining them and you their best beloved one are now to me flesh of my flesh blood of my blood kin of my kin my bountiful wine press for a while and shall be later on my companion and my helper you shall be avenged in turn for not one of them but shall minister to your needs but as yet you are to be punished for what you have done you have aided in thwarting me now you shall come to my call when my brain says come to you you shall cross land or sea to do my bidding and to that end this with that he pulled open his shirt and with his long sharp nails opened a vein in his breast when the blood began to spurt out he took my hands in one of his holding them tight and with the other seized my neck and pressed my mouth to the wound so that i must either suffocate or swallow some of the oh my god my god what have i done what have i done to deserve such a fate i who have tried to walk in meekness and righteousness all my days god pity me look down on a poor soul in worse than mortal peril and in mercy pity those to whom she is dear then she began to rub her lips as though to cleanse them from pollution as she was telling her terrible story the eastern sky began to quicken and everything became more and more clear harker was still and quiet but over his face as the awful narrative went on came a grey look which deepened and deepened in the morning light till when the first red streak of the coming dawn shot up the flesh stood darkly out against the whitening hair we have arranged that one of us is to stay within call of the unhappy pair till we can meet together and arrange about taking action of this i am sure the sun rises to day on no more miserable house in all the great round of its daily course chapter xxii jonathan harker s journal october as i must do something or go mad i write this diary it is now six o clock and we are to meet in the study in half an hour and take something to eat for dr van helsing and dr seward are agreed that if we do not eat we cannot work our best our best will be god knows required to day i must keep writing at every chance for i dare not stop to think all big and little must go down perhaps at the end the little things may teach us most the teaching big or little could not have landed mina or me anywhere worse than we are to day however we must trust and hope poor mina told me just now with the tears running down her dear cheeks that it is in trouble and trial that our faith is tested that we must keep on trusting and that god will aid us up to the end the end oh my god what end to work to work when dr van helsing and dr seward had come back from seeing poor renfield we went gravely into what was to be done first dr seward told us that when he and dr van helsing had gone down to the room below they had found renfield lying on the floor all in a heap his face was all bruised and crushed in and the bones of the neck were broken dr seward asked the attendant who was on duty in the passage if he had heard anything he said that he had been sitting down he confessed to half dozing when he heard loud voices in the room and then renfield had called out loudly several times god god god after that there was a sound of falling and when he entered the room he found him lying on the floor face down just as the doctors had seen him van helsing asked if he had heard voices or a voice and he said he could not say that at first it had seemed to him as if there were two but as there was no one in the room it could have been only one he could swear to it if required that the word god was spoken by the patient dr seward said to us when we were alone that he did not wish to go into the matter the question of an inquest had to be considered and it would never do to put forward the truth as no one would believe it as it was he thought that on the attendant s evidence he could give a certificate of death by misadventure in falling from bed in case the coroner should demand it there would be a formal inquest necessarily to the same result when the question began to be discussed as to what should be our next step the very first thing we decided was that mina should be in full confidence that nothing of any sort no matter how painful should be kept from her she herself agreed as to its wisdom and it was pitiful to see her so brave and yet so sorrowful and in such a depth of despair there must be no concealment she said alas we have had too much already and besides there is nothing in all the world that can give me more pain than i have already endured than i suffer now whatever may happen it must be of new hope or of new courage to me van helsing was looking at her fixedly as she spoke and said suddenly but quietly but dear madam mina are you not afraid not for yourself but for others from yourself after what has happened her face grew set in its lines but her eyes shone with the devotion of a martyr as she answered ah no for my mind is made up to what he asked gently whilst we were all very still for each in our own way we had a sort of vague idea of what she meant her answer came with direct simplicity as though she were simply stating a fact because if i find in myself and i shall watch keenly for it a sign of harm to any that i love i shall die you would not kill yourself he asked hoarsely i would if there were no friend who loved me who would save me such a pain and so desperate an effort she looked at him meaningly as she spoke he was sitting down but now he rose and came close to her and put his hand on her head as he said solemnly my child there is such an one if it were for your good for myself i could hold it in my account with god to find such an euthanasia for you even at this moment if it were best nay were it safe but my child for a moment he seemed choked and a great sob rose in his throat he gulped it down and went on there are here some who would stand between you and death you must not die you must not die by any hand but least of all by your own until the other who has fouled your sweet life is true dead you must not die for if he is still with the quick un dead your death would make you even as he is no you must live you must struggle and strive to live though death would seem a boon unspeakable you must fight death himself though he come to you in pain or in joy by the day or the night in safety or in peril on your living soul i charge you that you do not die nay nor think of death till this great evil be past the poor dear grew white as death and shock and shivered as i have seen a quicksand shake and shiver at the incoming of the tide we were all silent we could do nothing at length she grew more calm and turning to him said sweetly but oh so sorrowfully as she held out her hand i promise you my dear friend that if god will let me live i shall strive to do so till if it may be in his good time this horror may have passed away from me she was so good and brave that we all felt that our hearts were strengthened to work and endure for her and we began to discuss what we were to do i told her that she was to have all the papers in the safe and all the papers or diaries and phonographs we might hereafter use and was to keep the record as she had done before she was pleased with the prospect of anything to do if pleased could be used in connection with so grim an interest as usual van helsing had thought ahead of everyone else and was prepared with an exact ordering of our work it is perhaps well he said that at our meeting after our visit to carfax we decided not to do anything with the earth boxes that lay there had we done so the count must have guessed our purpose and would doubtless have taken measures in advance to frustrate such an effort with regard to the others but now he does not know our intentions nay more in all probability he does not know that such a power exists to us as can sterilise his lairs so that he cannot use them as of old we are now so much further advanced in our knowledge as to their disposition that when we have examined the house in piccadilly we may track the very last of them to day then is ours and in it rests our hope the sun that rose on our sorrow this morning guards us in its course until it sets to night that monster must retain whatever form he now has he is confined within the limitations of his earthly envelope he cannot melt into thin air nor disappear through cracks or chinks or crannies if he go through a doorway he must open the door like a mortal and so we have this day to hunt out all his lairs and sterilise them so we shall if we have not yet catch him and destroy him drive him to bay in some place where the catching and the destroying shall be in time sure here i started up for i could not contain myself at the thought that the minutes and seconds so preciously laden with mina s life and happiness were flying from us since whilst we talked action was impossible but van helsing held up his hand warningly nay friend jonathan he said in this the quickest way home is the longest way so your proverb say we shall all act and act with desperate quick when the time has come but think in all probable the key of the situation is in that house in piccadilly the count may have many houses which he has bought of them he will have deeds of purchase keys and other things he will have paper that he write on he will have his book of cheques there are many belongings that he must have somewhere why not in this place so central so quiet where he come and go by the front or the back at all hour when in the very vast of the traffic there is none to notice we shall go there and search that house and when we learn what it holds then we do what our friend arthur call in his phrases of hunt stop the earths and so we run down our old fox so is it not then let us come at once i cried we are wasting the precious precious time the professor did not move but simply said and how are we to get into that house in piccadilly any way i cried we shall break in if need be and your police where will they be and what will they say i was staggered but i knew that if he wished to delay he had a good reason for it so i said as quietly as i could don t wait more than need be you know i am sure what torture i am in ah my child that i do and indeed there is no wish of me to add to your anguish but just think what can we do until all the world be at movement then will come our time i have thought and thought and it seems to me that the simplest way is the best of all now we wish to get into the house but we have no key is it not so i nodded now suppose that you were in truth the owner of that house and could not still get in and think there was to you no conscience of the housebreaker what would you do i should get a respectable locksmith and set him to work to pick the lock for me and your police they would interfere would they not oh no not if they knew the man was properly employed then he looked at me as keenly as he spoke all that is in doubt is the conscience of the employer and the belief of your policemen as to whether or no that employer has a good conscience or a bad one your police must indeed be zealous men and clever oh so clever in reading the heart that they trouble themselves in such matter no no my friend jonathan you go take the lock off a hundred empty house in this your london or of any city in the world and if you do it as such things are rightly done and at the time such things are rightly done no one will interfere i have read of a gentleman who owned a so fine house in london and when he went for months of summer to switzerland and lock up his house some burglar came and broke window at back and got in then he went and made open the shutters in front and walk out and in through the door before the very eyes of the police then he have an auction in that house and advertise it and put up big notice and when the day come he sell off by a great auctioneer all the goods of that other man who own them then he go to a builder and he sell him that house making an agreement that he pull it down and take all away within a certain time and your police and other authority help him all they can and when that owner come back from his holiday in switzerland he find only an empty hole where his house had been this was all done en r gle and in our work we shall be en r gle too we shall not go so early that the policemen who have then little to think of shall deem it strange but we shall go after ten o clock when there are many about and such things would be done were we indeed owners of the house i could not but see how right he was and the terrible despair of mina s face became relaxed a thought there was hope in such good counsel van helsing went on when once within that house we may find more clues at any rate some of us can remain there whilst the rest find the other places where there be more earth boxes at bermondsey and mile end lord godalming stood up i can be of some use here he said i shall wire to my people to have horses and carriages where they will be most convenient look here old fellow said morris it is a capital idea to have all ready in case we want to go horsebacking but don t you think that one of your snappy carriages with its heraldic adornments in a byway of walworth or mile end would attract too much attention for our purposes it seems to me that we ought to take cabs when we go south or east and even leave them somewhere near the neighbourhood we are going to friend quincey is right said the professor his head is what you call in plane with the horizon it is a difficult thing that we go to do and we do not want no peoples to watch us if so it may mina took a growing interest in everything and i was rejoiced to see that the exigency of affairs was helping her to forget for a time the terrible experience of the night she was very very pale almost ghastly and so thin that her lips were drawn away showing her teeth in somewhat of prominence i did not mention this last lest it should give her needless pain but it made my blood run cold in my veins to think of what had occurred with poor lucy when the count had sucked her blood as yet there was no sign of the teeth growing sharper but the time as yet was short and there was time for fear when we came to the discussion of the sequence of our efforts and of the disposition of our forces there were new sources of doubt it was finally agreed that before starting for piccadilly we should destroy the count s lair close at hand in case he should find it out too soon we should thus be still ahead of him in our work of destruction and his presence in his purely material shape and at his weakest might give us some new clue as to the disposal of forces it was suggested by the professor that after our visit to carfax we should all enter the house in piccadilly that the two doctors and i should remain there whilst lord godalming and quincey found the lairs at walworth and mile end and destroyed them it was possible if not likely the professor urged that the count might appear in piccadilly during the day and that if so we might be able to cope with him then and there at any rate we might be able to follow him in force to this plan i strenuously objected and so far as my going was concerned for i said that i intended to stay and protect mina i thought that my mind was made up on the subject but mina would not listen to my objection she said that there might be some law matter in which i could be useful that amongst the count s papers might be some clue which i could understand out of my experience in transylvania and that as it was all the strength we could muster was required to cope with the count s extraordinary power i had to give in for mina s resolution was fixed she said that it was the last hope for her that we should all work together as for me she said i have no fear things have been as bad as they can be and whatever may happen must have in it some element of hope or comfort go my husband god can if he wishes it guard me as well alone as with any one present so i started up crying out then in god s name let us come at once for we are losing time the count may come to piccadilly earlier than we think not so said van helsing holding up his hand but why i asked do you forget he said with actually a smile that last night he banqueted heavily and will sleep late did i forget shall i ever can i ever can any of us ever forget that terrible scene mina struggled hard to keep her brave countenance but the pain overmastered her and she put her hands before her face and shuddered whilst she moaned van helsing had not intended to recall her frightful experience he had simply lost sight of her and her part in the affair in his intellectual effort when it struck him what he said he was horrified at his thoughtlessness and tried to comfort her oh madam mina he said dear dear madam mina alas that i of all who so reverence you should have said anything so forgetful these stupid old lips of mine and this stupid old head do not deserve so but you will forget it will you not he bent low beside her as he spoke she took his hand and looking at him through her tears said hoarsely no i shall not forget for it is well that i remember and with it i have so much in memory of you that is sweet that i take it all together now you must all be going soon breakfast is ready and we must all eat that we may be strong breakfast was a strange meal to us all we tried to be cheerful and encourage each other and mina was the brightest and most cheerful of us when it was over van helsing stood up and said now my dear friends we go forth to our terrible enterprise are we all armed as we were on that night when first we visited our enemy s lair armed against ghostly as well as carnal attack we all assured him then it is well now madam mina you are in any case quite safe here until the sunset and before then we shall return if we shall return but before we go let me see you armed against personal attack i have myself since you came down prepared your chamber by the placing of things of which we know so that he may not enter now let me guard yourself on your forehead i touch this piece of sacred wafer in the name of the father the son and there was a fearful scream which almost froze our hearts to hear as he had placed the wafer on mina s forehead it had seared it had burned into the flesh as though it had been a piece of white hot metal my poor darling s brain had told her the significance of the fact as quickly as her nerves received the pain of it and the two so overwhelmed her that her overwrought nature had its voice in that dreadful scream but the words to her thought came quickly the echo of the scream had not ceased to ring on the air when there came the reaction and she sank on her knees on the floor in an agony of abasement pulling her beautiful hair over her face as the leper of old his mantle she wailed out unclean unclean even the almighty shuns my polluted flesh i must bear this mark of shame upon my forehead until the judgment day they all paused i had thrown myself beside her in an agony of helpless grief and putting my arms around held her tight for a few minutes our sorrowful hearts beat together whilst the friends around us turned away their eyes that ran tears silently then van helsing turned and said gravely so gravely that i could not help feeling that he was in some way inspired and was stating things outside himself it may be that you may have to bear that mark till god himself see fit as he most surely shall on the judgment day to redress all wrongs of the earth and of his children that he has placed thereon and oh madam mina my dear my dear may we who love you be there to see when that red scar the sign of god s knowledge of what has been shall pass away and leave your forehead as pure as the heart we know for so surely as we live that scar shall pass away when god sees right to lift the burden that is hard upon us till then we bear our cross as his son did in obedience to his will it may be that we are chosen instruments of his good pleasure and that we ascend to his bidding as that other through stripes and shame through tears and blood through doubts and fears and all that makes the difference between god and man there was hope in his words and comfort and they made for resignation mina and i both felt so and simultaneously we each took one of the old man s hands and bent over and kissed it then without a word we all knelt down together and all holding hands swore to be true to each other we men pledged ourselves to raise the veil of sorrow from the head of her whom each in his own way we loved and we prayed for help and guidance in the terrible task which lay before us it was then time to start so i said farewell to mina a parting which neither of us shall forget to our dying day and we set out to one thing i have made up my mind if we find out that mina must be a vampire in the end then she shall not go into that unknown and terrible land alone i suppose it is thus that in old times one vampire meant many just as their hideous bodies could only rest in sacred earth so the holiest love was the recruiting sergeant for their ghastly ranks we entered carfax without trouble and found all things the same as on the first occasion it was hard to believe that amongst so prosaic surroundings of neglect and dust and decay there was any ground for such fear as already we knew had not our minds been made up and had there not been terrible memories to spur us on we could hardly have proceeded with our task we found no papers or any sign of use in the house and in the old chapel the great boxes looked just as we had seen them last dr van helsing said to us solemnly as we stood before them and now my friends we have a duty here to do we must sterilise this earth so sacred of holy memories that he has brought from a far distant land for such fell use he has chosen this earth because it has been holy thus we defeat him with his own weapon for we make it more holy still it was sanctified to such use of man now we sanctify it to god as he spoke he took from his bag a screwdriver and a wrench and very soon the top of one of the cases was thrown open the earth smelled musty and close but we did not somehow seem to mind for our attention was concentrated on the professor taking from his box a piece of the sacred wafer he laid it reverently on the earth and then shutting down the lid began to screw it home we aiding him as he worked one by one we treated in the same way each of the great boxes and left them as we had found them to all appearance but in each was a portion of the host when we closed the door behind us the professor said solemnly so much is already done if it may be that with all the others we can be so successful then the sunset of this evening may shine on madam mina s forehead all white as ivory and with no stain as we passed across the lawn on our way to the station to catch our train we could see the front of the asylum i looked eagerly and in the window of my own room saw mina i waved my hand to her and nodded to tell that our work there was successfully accomplished she nodded in reply to show that she understood the last i saw she was waving her hand in farewell it was with a heavy heart that we sought the station and just caught the train which was steaming in as we reached the platform i have written this in the train piccadilly o clock just before we reached fenchurch street lord godalming said to me quincey and i will find a locksmith you had better not come with us in case there should be any difficulty for under the circumstances it wouldn t seem so bad for us to break into an empty house but you are a solicitor and the incorporated law society might tell you that you should have known better i demurred as to my not sharing any danger even of odium but he went on besides it will attract less attention if there are not too many of us my title will make it all right with the locksmith and with any policeman that may come along you had better go with jack and the professor and stay in the green park somewhere in sight of the house and when you see the door opened and the smith has gone away do you all come across we shall be on the lookout for you and shall let you in the advice is good said van helsing so we said no more godalming and morris hurried off in a cab we following in another at the corner of arlington street our contingent got out and strolled into the green park my heart beat as i saw the house on which so much of our hope was centred looming up grim and silent in its deserted condition amongst its more lively and spruce looking neighbours we sat down on a bench within good view and began to smoke cigars so as to attract as little attention as possible the minutes seemed to pass with leaden feet as we waited for the coming of the others at length we saw a four wheeler drive up out of it in leisurely fashion got lord godalming and morris and down from the box descended a thick set working man with his rush woven basket of tools morris paid the cabman who touched his hat and drove away together the two ascended the steps and lord godalming pointed out what he wanted done the workman took off his coat leisurely and hung it on one of the spikes of the rail saying something to a policeman who just then sauntered along the policeman nodded acquiescence and the man kneeling down placed his bag beside him after searching through it he took out a selection of tools which he produced to lay beside him in orderly fashion then he stood up looked into the keyhole blew into it and turning to his employers made some remark lord godalming smiled and the man lifted a good sized bunch of keys selecting one of them he began to probe the lock as if feeling his way with it after fumbling about for a bit he tried a second and then a third all at once the door opened under a slight push from him and he and the two others entered the hall we sat still my own cigar burnt furiously but van helsing s went cold altogether we waited patiently as we saw the workman come out and bring in his bag then he held the door partly open steadying it with his knees whilst he fitted a key to the lock this he finally handed to lord godalming who took out his purse and gave him something the man touched his hat took his bag put on his coat and departed not a soul took the slightest notice of the whole transaction when the man had fairly gone we three crossed the street and knocked at the door it was immediately opened by quincey morris beside whom stood lord godalming lighting a cigar the place smells so vilely said the latter as we came in it did indeed smell vilely like the old chapel at carfax and with our previous experience it was plain to us that the count had been using the place pretty freely we moved to explore the house all keeping together in case of attack for we knew we had a strong and wily enemy to deal with and as yet we did not know whether the count might not be in the house in the dining room which lay at the back of the hall we found eight boxes of earth eight boxes only out of the nine which we sought our work was not over and would never be until we should have found the missing box first we opened the shutters of the window which looked out across a narrow stone flagged yard at the blank face of a stable pointed to look like the front of a miniature house there were no windows in it so we were not afraid of being over looked we did not lose any time in examining the chests with the tools which we had brought with us we opened them one by one and treated them as we had treated those others in the old chapel it was evident to us that the count was not at present in the house and we proceeded to search for any of his effects after a cursory glance at the rest of the rooms from basement to attic we came to the conclusion that the dining room contained any effects which might belong to the count and so we proceeded to minutely examine them they lay in a sort of orderly disorder on the great dining room table there were title deeds of the piccadilly house in a great bundle deeds of the purchase of the houses at mile end and bermondsey note paper envelopes and pens and ink all were covered up in thin wrapping paper to keep them from the dust there were also a clothes brush a brush and comb and a jug and basin the latter containing dirty water which was reddened as if with blood last of all was a little heap of keys of all sorts and sizes probably those belonging to the other houses when we had examined this last find lord godalming and quincey morris taking accurate notes of the various addresses of the houses in the east and the south took with them the keys in a great bunch and set out to destroy the boxes in these places the rest of us are with what patience we can waiting their return or the coming of the count chapter xxiii dr seward s diary october the time seemed terribly long whilst we were waiting for the coming of godalming and quincey morris the professor tried to keep our minds active by using them all the time i could see his beneficent purpose by the side glances which he threw from time to time at harker the poor fellow is overwhelmed in a misery that is appalling to see last night he was a frank happy looking man with strong youthful face full of energy and with dark brown hair to day he is a drawn haggard old man whose white hair matches well with the hollow burning eyes and grief written lines of his face his energy is still intact in fact he is like a living flame this may yet be his salvation for if all go well it will tide him over the despairing period he will then in a kind of way wake again to the realities of life poor fellow i thought my own trouble was bad enough but his the professor knows this well enough and is doing his best to keep his mind active what he has been saying was under the circumstances of absorbing interest so well as i can remember here it is i have studied over and over again since they came into my hands all the papers relating to this monster and the more i have studied the greater seems the necessity to utterly stamp him out all through there are signs of his advance not only of his power but of his knowledge of it as i learned from the researches of my friend arminus of buda pesth he was in life a most wonderful man soldier statesman and alchemist which latter was the highest development of the science knowledge of his time he had a mighty brain a learning beyond compare and a heart that knew no fear and no remorse he dared even to attend the scholomance and there was no branch of knowledge of his time that he did not essay well in him the brain powers survived the physical death though it would seem that memory was not all complete in some faculties of mind he has been and is only a child but he is growing and some things that were childish at the first are now of man s stature he is experimenting and doing it well and if it had not been that we have crossed his path he would be yet he may be yet if we fail the father or furtherer of a new order of beings whose road must lead through death not life harker groaned and said and this is all arrayed against my darling but how is he experimenting the knowledge may help us to defeat him he has all along since his coming been trying his power slowly but surely that big child brain of his is working well for us it is as yet a child brain for had he dared at the first to attempt certain things he would long ago have been beyond our power however he means to succeed and a man who has centuries before him can afford to wait and to go slow festina lente may well be his motto i fail to understand said harker wearily oh do be more plain to me perhaps grief and trouble are dulling my brain the professor laid his hand tenderly on his shoulder as he spoke ah my child i will be plain do you not see how of late this monster has been creeping into knowledge experimentally how he has been making use of the zo phagous patient to effect his entry into friend john s home for your vampire though in all afterwards he can come when and how he will must at the first make entry only when asked thereto by an inmate but these are not his most important experiments do we not see how at the first all these so great boxes were moved by others he knew not then but that must be so but all the time that so great child brain of his was growing and he began to consider whether he might not himself move the box so he began to help and then when he found that this be all right he try to move them all alone and so he progress and he scatter these graves of him and none but he know where they are hidden he may have intend to bury them deep in the ground so that he only use them in the night or at such time as he can change his form they do him equal well and none may know these are his hiding place but my child do not despair this knowledge come to him just too late already all of his lairs but one be sterilise as for him and before the sunset this shall be so then he have no place where he can move and hide i delayed this morning that so we might be sure is there not more at stake for us than for him then why we not be even more careful than him by my clock it is one hour and already if all be well friend arthur and quincey are on their way to us to day is our day and we must go sure if slow and lose no chance see there are five of us when those absent ones return whilst he was speaking we were startled by a knock at the hall door the double postman s knock of the telegraph boy we all moved out to the hall with one impulse and van helsing holding up his hand to us to keep silence stepped to the door and opened it the boy handed in a despatch the professor closed the door again and after looking at the direction opened it and read aloud look out for d he has just now come from carfax hurriedly and hastened towards the south he seems to be going the round and may want to see you mina there was a pause broken by jonathan harker s voice now god be thanked we shall soon meet van helsing turned to him quickly and said god will act in his own way and time do not fear and do not rejoice as yet for what we wish for at the moment may be our undoings i care for nothing now he answered hotly except to wipe out this brute from the face of creation i would sell my soul to do it oh hush hush my child said van helsing god does not purchase souls in this wise and the devil though he may purchase does not keep faith but god is merciful and just and knows your pain and your devotion to that dear madam mina think you how her pain would be doubled did she but hear your wild words do not fear any of us we are all devoted to this cause and to day shall see the end the time is coming for action to day this vampire is limit to the powers of man and till sunset he may not change it will take him time to arrive here see it is twenty minutes past one and there are yet some times before he can hither come be he never so quick what we must hope for is that my lord arthur and quincey arrive first about half an hour after we had received mrs harker s telegram there came a quiet resolute knock at the hall door it was just an ordinary knock such as is given hourly by thousands of gentlemen but it made the professor s heart and mine beat loudly we looked at each other and together moved out into the hall we each held ready to use our various armaments the spiritual in the left hand the mortal in the right van helsing pulled back the latch and holding the door half open stood back having both hands ready for action the gladness of our hearts must have shown upon our faces when on the step close to the door we saw lord godalming and quincey morris they came quickly in and closed the door behind them the former saying as they moved along the hall it is all right we found both places six boxes in each and we destroyed them all destroyed asked the professor for him we were silent for a minute and then quincey said there s nothing to do but to wait here if however he doesn t turn up by five o clock we must start off for it won t do to leave mrs harker alone after sunset he will be here before long now said van helsing who had been consulting his pocket book nota bene in madam s telegram he went south from carfax that means he went to cross the river and he could only do so at slack of tide which should be something before one o clock that he went south has a meaning for us he is as yet only suspicious and he went from carfax first to the place where he would suspect interference least you must have been at bermondsey only a short time before him that he is not here already shows that he went to mile end next this took him some time for he would then have to be carried over the river in some way believe me my friends we shall not have long to wait now we should have ready some plan of attack so that we may throw away no chance hush there is no time now have all your arms be ready he held up a warning hand as he spoke for we all could hear a key softly inserted in the lock of the hall door i could not but admire even at such a moment the way in which a dominant spirit asserted itself in all our hunting parties and adventures in different parts of the world quincey morris had always been the one to arrange the plan of action and arthur and i had been accustomed to obey him implicitly now the old habit seemed to be renewed instinctively with a swift glance around the room he at once laid out our plan of attack and without speaking a word with a gesture placed us each in position van helsing harker and i were just behind the door so that when it was opened the professor could guard it whilst we two stepped between the incomer and the door godalming behind and quincey in front stood just out of sight ready to move in front of the window we waited in a suspense that made the seconds pass with nightmare slowness the slow careful steps came along the hall the count was evidently prepared for some surprise at least he feared it suddenly with a single bound he leaped into the room winning a way past us before any of us could raise a hand to stay him there was something so panther like in the movement something so unhuman that it seemed to sober us all from the shock of his coming the first to act was harker who with a quick movement threw himself before the door leading into the room in the front of the house as the count saw us a horrible sort of snarl passed over his face showing the eye teeth long and pointed but the evil smile as quickly passed into a cold stare of lion like disdain his expression again changed as with a single impulse we all advanced upon him it was a pity that we had not some better organised plan of attack for even at the moment i wondered what we were to do i did not myself know whether our lethal weapons would avail us anything harker evidently meant to try the matter for he had ready his great kukri knife and made a fierce and sudden cut at him the blow was a powerful one only the diabolical quickness of the count s leap back saved him a second less and the trenchant blade had shorne through his heart as it was the point just cut the cloth of his coat making a wide gap whence a bundle of bank notes and a stream of gold fell out the expression of the count s face was so hellish that for a moment i feared for harker though i saw him throw the terrible knife aloft again for another stroke instinctively i moved forward with a protective impulse holding the crucifix and wafer in my left hand i felt a mighty power fly along my arm and it was without surprise that i saw the monster cower back before a similar movement made spontaneously by each one of us it would be impossible to describe the expression of hate and baffled malignity of anger and hellish rage which came over the count s face his waxen hue became greenish yellow by the contrast of his burning eyes and the red scar on the forehead showed on the pallid skin like a palpitating wound the next instant with a sinuous dive he swept under harker s arm ere his blow could fall and grasping a handful of the money from the floor dashed across the room threw himself at the window amid the crash and glitter of the falling glass he tumbled into the flagged area below through the sound of the shivering glass i could hear the ting of the gold as some of the sovereigns fell on the flagging we ran over and saw him spring unhurt from the ground he rushing up the steps crossed the flagged yard and pushed open the stable door there he turned and spoke to us you think to baffle me you with your pale faces all in a row like sheep in a butcher s you shall be sorry yet each one of you you think you have left me without a place to rest but i have more my revenge is just begun i spread it over centuries and time is on my side your girls that you all love are mine already and through them you and others shall yet be mine my creatures to do my bidding and to be my jackals when i want to feed bah with a contemptuous sneer he passed quickly through the door and we heard the rusty bolt creak as he fastened it behind him a door beyond opened and shut the first of us to speak was the professor as realising the difficulty of following him through the stable we moved toward the hall we have learnt something much notwithstanding his brave words he fears us he fear time he fear want for if not why he hurry so his very tone betray him or my ears deceive why take that money you follow quick you are hunters of wild beast and understand it so for me i make sure that nothing here may be of use to him if so that he return as he spoke he put the money remaining into his pocket took the title deeds in the bundle as harker had left them and swept the remaining things into the open fireplace where he set fire to them with a match godalming and morris had rushed out into the yard and harker had lowered himself from the window to follow the count he had however bolted the stable door and by the time they had forced it open there was no sign of him van helsing and i tried to make inquiry at the back of the house but the mews was deserted and no one had seen him depart it was now late in the afternoon and sunset was not far off we had to recognise that our game was up with heavy hearts we agreed with the professor when he said let us go back to madam mina poor poor dear madam mina all we can do just now is done and we can there at least protect her but we need not despair there is but one more earth box and we must try to find it when that is done all may yet be well i could see that he spoke as bravely as he could to comfort harker the poor fellow was quite broken down now and again he gave a low groan which he could not suppress he was thinking of his wife with sad hearts we came back to my house where we found mrs harker waiting us with an appearance of cheerfulness which did honour to her bravery and unselfishness when she saw our faces her own became as pale as death for a second or two her eyes were closed as if she were in secret prayer and then she said cheerfully i can never thank you all enough oh my poor darling as she spoke she took her husband s grey head in her hands and kissed it lay your poor head here and rest it all will yet be well dear god will protect us if he so will it in his good intent the poor fellow groaned there was no place for words in his sublime misery we had a sort of perfunctory supper together and i think it cheered us all up somewhat it was perhaps the mere animal heat of food to hungry people for none of us had eaten anything since breakfast or the sense of companionship may have helped us but anyhow we were all less miserable and saw the morrow as not altogether without hope true to our promise we told mrs harker everything which had passed and although she grew snowy white at times when danger had seemed to threaten her husband and red at others when his devotion to her was manifested she listened bravely and with calmness when we came to the part where harker had rushed at the count so recklessly she clung to her husband s arm and held it tight as though her clinging could protect him from any harm that might come she said nothing however till the narration was all done and matters had been brought right up to the present time then without letting go her husband s hand she stood up amongst us and spoke oh that i could give any idea of the scene of that sweet sweet good good woman in all the radiant beauty of her youth and animation with the red scar on her forehead of which she was conscious and which we saw with grinding of our teeth remembering whence and how it came her loving kindness against our grim hate her tender faith against all our fears and doubting and we knowing that so far as symbols went she with all her goodness and purity and faith was outcast from god jonathan she said and the word sounded like music on her lips it was so full of love and tenderness jonathan dear and you all my true true friends i want you to bear something in mind through all this dreadful time i know that you must fight that you must destroy even as you destroyed the false lucy so that the true lucy might live hereafter but it is not a work of hate that poor soul who has wrought all this misery is the saddest case of all just think what will be his joy when he too is destroyed in his worser part that his better part may have spiritual immortality you must be pitiful to him too though it may not hold your hands from his destruction as she spoke i could see her husband s face darken and draw together as though the passion in him were shrivelling his being to its core instinctively the clasp on his wife s hand grew closer till his knuckles looked white she did not flinch from the pain which i knew she must have suffered but looked at him with eyes that were more appealing than ever as she stopped speaking he leaped to his feet almost tearing his hand from hers as he spoke may god give him into my hand just for long enough to destroy that earthly life of him which we are aiming at if beyond it i could send his soul for ever and ever to burning hell i would do it oh hush oh hush in the name of the good god don t say such things jonathan my husband or you will crush me with fear and horror just think my dear i have been thinking all this long long day of it that perhaps some day i too may need such pity and that some other like you and with equal cause for anger may deny it to me oh my husband my husband indeed i would have spared you such a thought had there been another way but i pray that god may not have treasured your wild words except as the heart broken wail of a very loving and sorely stricken man oh god let these poor white hairs go in evidence of what he has suffered who all his life has done no wrong and on whom so many sorrows have come we men were all in tears now there was no resisting them and we wept openly she wept too to see that her sweeter counsels had prevailed her husband flung himself on his knees beside her and putting his arms round her hid his face in the folds of her dress van helsing beckoned to us and we stole out of the room leaving the two loving hearts alone with their god before they retired the professor fixed up the room against any coming of the vampire and assured mrs harker that she might rest in peace she tried to school herself to the belief and manifestly for her husband s sake tried to seem content it was a brave struggle and was i think and believe not without its reward van helsing had placed at hand a bell which either of them was to sound in case of any emergency when they had retired quincey godalming and i arranged that we should sit up dividing the night between us and watch over the safety of the poor stricken lady the first watch falls to quincey so the rest of us shall be off to bed as soon as we can godalming has already turned in for his is the second watch now that my work is done i too shall go to bed jonathan harker s journal october close to midnight i thought yesterday would never end there was over me a yearning for sleep in some sort of blind belief that to wake would be to find things changed and that any change must now be for the better before we parted we discussed what our next step was to be but we could arrive at no result all we knew was that one earth box remained and that the count alone knew where it was if he chooses to lie hidden he may baffle us for years and in the meantime the thought is too horrible i dare not think of it even now this i know that if ever there was a woman who was all perfection that one is my poor wronged darling i love her a thousand times more for her sweet pity of last night a pity that made my own hate of the monster seem despicable surely god will not permit the world to be the poorer by the loss of such a creature this is hope to me we are all drifting reefwards now and faith is our only anchor thank god mina is sleeping and sleeping without dreams i fear what her dreams might be like with such terrible memories to ground them in she has not been so calm within my seeing since the sunset then for a while there came over her face a repose which was like spring after the blasts of march i thought at the time that it was the softness of the red sunset on her face but somehow now i think it has a deeper meaning i am not sleepy myself though i am weary weary to death however i must try to sleep for there is to morrow to think of and there is no rest for me until later i must have fallen asleep for i was awaked by mina who was sitting up in bed with a startled look on her face i could see easily for we did not leave the room in darkness she had placed a warning hand over my mouth and now she whispered in my ear hush there is someone in the corridor i got up softly and crossing the room gently opened the door just outside stretched on a mattress lay mr morris wide awake he raised a warning hand for silence as he whispered to me hush go back to bed it is all right one of us will be here all night we don t mean to take any chances his look and gesture forbade discussion so i came back and told mina she sighed and positively a shadow of a smile stole over her poor pale face as she put her arms round me and said softly oh thank god for good brave men with a sigh she sank back again to sleep i write this now as i am not sleepy though i must try again october morning once again during the night i was wakened by mina this time we had all had a good sleep for the grey of the coming dawn was making the windows into sharp oblongs and the gas flame was like a speck rather than a disc of light she said to me hurriedly go call the professor i want to see him at once why i asked i have an idea i suppose it must have come in the night and matured without my knowing it he must hypnotise me before the dawn and then i shall be able to speak go quick dearest the time is getting close i went to the door dr seward was resting on the mattress and seeing me he sprang to his feet is anything wrong he asked in alarm no i replied but mina wants to see dr van helsing at once i will go he said and hurried into the professor s room in two or three minutes later van helsing was in the room in his dressing gown and mr morris and lord godalming were with dr seward at the door asking questions when the professor saw mina smile a positive smile ousted the anxiety of his face he rubbed his hands as he said oh my dear madam mina this is indeed a change see friend jonathan we have got our dear madam mina as of old back to us to day then turning to her he said cheerfully and what am i do for you for at this hour you do not want me for nothings i want you to hypnotise me she said do it before the dawn for i feel that then i can speak and speak freely be quick for the time is short without a word he motioned her to sit up in bed looking fixedly at her he commenced to make passes in front of her from over the top of her head downward with each hand in turn mina gazed at him fixedly for a few minutes during which my own heart beat like a trip hammer for i felt that some crisis was at hand gradually her eyes closed and she sat stock still only by the gentle heaving of her bosom could one know that she was alive the professor made a few more passes and then stopped and i could see that his forehead was covered with great beads of perspiration mina opened her eyes but she did not seem the same woman there was a far away look in her eyes and her voice had a sad dreaminess which was new to me raising his hand to impose silence the professor motioned to me to bring the others in they came on tip toe closing the door behind them and stood at the foot of the bed looking on mina appeared not to see them the stillness was broken by van helsing s voice speaking in a low level tone which would not break the current of her thoughts where are you the answer came in a neutral way i do not know sleep has no place it can call its own for several minutes there was silence mina sat rigid and the professor stood staring at her fixedly the rest of us hardly dared to breathe the room was growing lighter without taking his eyes from mina s face dr van helsing motioned me to pull up the blind i did so and the day seemed just upon us a red streak shot up and a rosy light seemed to diffuse itself through the room on the instant the professor spoke again where are you now the answer came dreamily but with intention it were as though she were interpreting something i have heard her use the same tone when reading her shorthand notes i do not know it is all strange to me what do you see i can see nothing it is all dark what do you hear i could detect the strain in the professor s patient voice the lapping of water it is gurgling by and little waves leap i can hear them on the outside then you are on a ship we all looked at each other trying to glean something each from the other we were afraid to think the answer came quick oh yes what else do you hear the sound of men stamping overhead as they run about there is the creaking of a chain and the loud tinkle as the check of the capstan falls into the rachet what are you doing i am still oh so still it is like death the voice faded away into a deep breath as of one sleeping and the open eyes closed again by this time the sun had risen and we were all in the full light of day dr van helsing placed his hands on mina s shoulders and laid her head down softly on her pillow she lay like a sleeping child for a few moments and then with a long sigh awoke and stared in wonder to see us all around her have i been talking in my sleep was all she said she seemed however to know the situation without telling though she was eager to know what she had told the professor repeated the conversation and she said then there is not a moment to lose it may not be yet too late mr morris and lord godalming started for the door but the professor s calm voice called them back stay my friends that ship wherever it was was weighing anchor whilst she spoke there are many ships weighing anchor at the moment in your so great port of london which of them is it that you seek god be thanked that we have once again a clue though whither it may lead us we know not we have been blind somewhat blind after the manner of men since when we can look back we see what we might have seen looking forward if we had been able to see what we might have seen alas but that sentence is a puddle is it not we can know now what was in the count s mind when he seize that money though jonathan s so fierce knife put him in the danger that even he dread he meant escape hear me escape he saw that with but one earth box left and a pack of men following like dogs after a fox this london was no place for him he have take his last earth box on board a ship and he leave the land he think to escape but no we follow him tally ho as friend arthur would say when he put on his red frock our old fox is wily oh so wily and we must follow with wile i too am wily and i think his mind in a little while in meantime we may rest and in peace for there are waters between us which he do not want to pass and which he could not if he would unless the ship were to touch the land and then only at full or slack tide see and the sun is just rose and all day to sunset is to us let us take bath and dress and have breakfast which we all need and which we can eat comfortably since he be not in the same land with us mina looked at him appealingly as she asked but why need we seek him further when he is gone away from us he took her hand and patted it as he replied ask me nothings as yet when we have breakfast then i answer all questions he would say no more and we separated to dress after breakfast mina repeated her question he looked at her gravely for a minute and then said sorrowfully because my dear dear madam mina now more than ever must we find him even if we have to follow him to the jaws of hell she grew paler as she asked faintly why because he answered solemnly he can live for centuries and you are but mortal woman time is now to be dreaded since once he put that mark upon your throat i was just in time to catch her as she fell forward in a faint chapter xxiv dr seward s phonograph diary spoken by van helsing this to jonathan harker you are to stay with your dear madam mina we shall go to make our search if i can call it so for it is not search but knowing and we seek confirmation only but do you stay and take care of her to day this is your best and most holiest office this day nothing can find him here let me tell you that so you will know what we four know already for i have tell them he our enemy have gone away he have gone back to his castle in transylvania i know it so well as if a great hand of fire wrote it on the wall he have prepare for this in some way and that last earth box was ready to ship somewheres for this he took the money for this he hurry at the last lest we catch him before the sun go down it was his last hope save that he might hide in the tomb that he think poor miss lucy being as he thought like him keep open to him but there was not of time when that fail he make straight for his last resource his last earth work i might say did i wish double entente he is clever oh so clever he know that his game here was finish and so he decide he go back home he find ship going by the route he came and he go in it we go off now to find what ship and whither bound when we have discover that we come back and tell you all then we will comfort you and poor dear madam mina with new hope for it will be hope when you think it over that all is not lost this very creature that we pursue he take hundreds of years to get so far as london and yet in one day when we know of the disposal of him we drive him out he is finite though he is powerful to do much harm and suffers not as we do but we are strong each in our purpose and we are all more strong together take heart afresh dear husband of madam mina this battle is but begun and in the end we shall win so sure as that god sits on high to watch over his children therefore be of much comfort till we return van helsing jonathan harker s journal october when i read to mina van helsing s message in the phonograph the poor girl brightened up considerably already the certainty that the count is out of the country has given her comfort and comfort is strength to her for my own part now that his horrible danger is not face to face with us it seems almost impossible to believe in it even my own terrible experiences in castle dracula seem like a long forgotten dream here in the crisp autumn air in the bright sunlight alas how can i disbelieve in the midst of my thought my eye fell on the red scar on my poor darling s white forehead whilst that lasts there can be no disbelief and afterwards the very memory of it will keep faith crystal clear mina and i fear to be idle so we have been over all the diaries again and again somehow although the reality seems greater each time the pain and the fear seem less there is something of a guiding purpose manifest throughout which is comforting mina says that perhaps we are the instruments of ultimate good it may be i shall try to think as she does we have never spoken to each other yet of the future it is better to wait till we see the professor and the others after their investigations the day is running by more quickly than i ever thought a day could run for me again it is now three o clock mina harker s journal october p m our meeting for report present professor van helsing lord godalming dr seward mr quincey morris jonathan harker mina harker dr van helsing described what steps were taken during the day to discover on what boat and whither bound count dracula made his escape as i knew that he wanted to get back to transylvania i felt sure that he must go by the danube mouth or by somewhere in the black sea since by that way he come it was a dreary blank that was before us omne ignotum pro magnifico and so with heavy hearts we start to find what ships leave for the black sea last night he was in sailing ship since madam mina tell of sails being set these not so important as to go in your list of the shipping in the times and so we go by suggestion of lord godalming to your lloyd s where are note of all ships that sail however so small there we find that only one black sea bound ship go out with the tide she is the czarina catherine and she sail from doolittle s wharf for varna and thence on to other parts and up the danube soh said i this is the ship whereon is the count so off we go to doolittle s wharf and there we find a man in an office of wood so small that the man look bigger than the office from him we inquire of the goings of the czarina catherine he swear much and he red face and loud of voice but he good fellow all the same and when quincey give him something from his pocket which crackle as he roll it up and put it in a so small bag which he have hid deep in his clothing he still better fellow and humble servant to us he come with us and ask many men who are rough and hot these be better fellows too when they have been no more thirsty they say much of blood and bloom and of others which i comprehend not though i guess what they mean but nevertheless they tell us all things which we want to know they make known to us among them how last afternoon at about five o clock comes a man so hurry a tall man thin and pale with high nose and teeth so white and eyes that seem to be burning that he be all in black except that he have a hat of straw which suit not him or the time that he scatter his money in making quick inquiry as to what ship sails for the black sea and for where some took him to the office and then to the ship where he will not go aboard but halt at shore end of gang plank and ask that the captain come to him the captain come when told that he will be pay well and though he swear much at the first he agree to term then the thin man go and some one tell him where horse and cart can be hired he go there and soon he come again himself driving cart on which a great box this he himself lift down though it take several to put it on truck for the ship he give much talk to captain as to how and where his box is to be place but the captain like it not and swear at him in many tongues and tell him that if he like he can come and see where it shall be but he say no that he come not yet for that he have much to do whereupon the captain tell him that he had better be quick with blood for that his ship will leave the place of blood before the turn of the tide with blood then the thin man smile and say that of course he must go when he think fit but he will be surprise if he go quite so soon the captain swear again polyglot and the thin man make him bow and thank him and say that he will so far intrude on his kindness as to come aboard before the sailing final the captain more red than ever and in more tongues tell him that he doesn t want no frenchmen with bloom upon them and also with blood in his ship with blood on her also and so after asking where there might be close at hand a ship where he might purchase ship forms he departed no one knew where he went or bloomin well cared as they said for they had something else to think of well with blood again for it soon became apparent to all that the czarina catherine would not sail as was expected a thin mist began to creep up from the river and it grew and grew till soon a dense fog enveloped the ship and all around her the captain swore polyglot very polyglot polyglot with bloom and blood but he could do nothing the water rose and rose and he began to fear that he would lose the tide altogether he was in no friendly mood when just at full tide the thin man came up the gang plank again and asked to see where his box had been stowed then the captain replied that he wished that he and his box old and with much bloom and blood were in hell but the thin man did not be offend and went down with the mate and saw where it was place and came up and stood awhile on deck in fog he must have come off by himself for none notice him indeed they thought not of him for soon the fog begin to melt away and all was clear again my friends of the thirst and the language that was of bloom and blood laughed as they told how the captain s swears exceeded even his usual polyglot and was more than ever full of picturesque when on questioning other mariners who were on movement up and down on the river that hour he found that few of them had seen any of fog at all except where it lay round the wharf however the ship went out on the ebb tide and was doubtless by morning far down the river mouth she was by then when they told us well out to sea and so my dear madam mina it is that we have to rest for a time for our enemy is on the sea with the fog at his command on his way to the danube mouth to sail a ship takes time go she never so quick and when we start we go on land more quick and we meet him there our best hope is to come on him when in the box between sunrise and sunset for then he can make no struggle and we may deal with him as we should there are days for us in which we can make ready our plan we know all about where he go for we have seen the owner of the ship who have shown us invoices and all papers that can be the box we seek is to be landed in varna and to be given to an agent one ristics who will there present his credentials and so our merchant friend will have done his part when he ask if there be any wrong for that so he can telegraph and have inquiry made at varna we say no for what is to be done is not for police or of the customs it must be done by us alone and in our own way when dr van helsing had done speaking i asked him if he were certain that the count had remained on board the ship he replied we have the best proof of that your own evidence when in the hypnotic trance this morning i asked him again if it were really necessary that they should pursue the count for oh i dread jonathan leaving me and i know that he would surely go if the others went he answered in growing passion at first quietly as he went on however he grew more angry and more forceful till in the end we could not but see wherein was at least some of that personal dominance which made him so long a master amongst men yes it is necessary necessary necessary for your sake in the first and then for the sake of humanity this monster has done much harm already in the narrow scope where he find himself and in the short time when as yet he was only as a body groping his so small measure in darkness and not knowing all this have i told these others you my dear madam mina will learn it in the phonograph of my friend john or in that of your husband i have told them how the measure of leaving his own barren land barren of peoples and coming to a new land where life of man teems till they are like the multitude of standing corn was the work of centuries were another of the un dead like him to try to do what he has done perhaps not all the centuries of the world that have been or that will be could aid him with this one all the forces of nature that are occult and deep and strong must have worked together in some wondrous way the very place where he have been alive un dead for all these centuries is full of strangeness of the geologic and chemical world there are deep caverns and fissures that reach none know whither there have been volcanoes some of whose openings still send out waters of strange properties and gases that kill or make to vivify doubtless there is something magnetic or electric in some of these combinations of occult forces which work for physical life in strange way and in himself were from the first some great qualities in a hard and warlike time he was celebrate that he have more iron nerve more subtle brain more braver heart than any man in him some vital principle have in strange way found their utmost and as his body keep strong and grow and thrive so his brain grow too all this without that diabolic aid which is surely to him for it have to yield to the powers that come from and are symbolic of good and now this is what he is to us he have infect you oh forgive me my dear that i must say such but it is for good of you that i speak he infect you in such wise that even if he do no more you have only to live to live in your own old sweet way and so in time death which is of man s common lot and with god s sanction shall make you like to him this must not be we have sworn together that it must not thus are we ministers of god s own wish that the world and men for whom his son die will not be given over to monsters whose very existence would defame him he have allowed us to redeem one soul already and we go out as the old knights of the cross to redeem more like them we shall travel towards the sunrise and like them if we fall we fall in good cause he paused and i said but will not the count take his rebuff wisely since he has been driven from england will he not avoid it as a tiger does the village from which he has been hunted aha he said your simile of the tiger good for me and i shall adopt him your man eater as they of india call the tiger who has once tasted blood of the human care no more for the other prey but prowl unceasing till he get him this that we hunt from our village is a tiger too a man eater and he never cease to prowl nay in himself he is not one to retire and stay afar in his life his living life he go over the turkey frontier and attack his enemy on his own ground he be beaten back but did he stay no he come again and again and again look at his persistence and endurance with the child brain that was to him he have long since conceive the idea of coming to a great city what does he do he find out the place of all the world most of promise for him then he deliberately set himself down to prepare for the task he find in patience just how is his strength and what are his powers he study new tongues he learn new social life new environment of old ways the politic the law the finance the science the habit of a new land and a new people who have come to be since he was his glimpse that he have had whet his appetite only and enkeen his desire nay it help him to grow as to his brain for it all prove to him how right he was at the first in his surmises he have done this alone all alone from a ruin tomb in a forgotten land what more may he not do when the greater world of thought is open to him he that can smile at death as we know him who can flourish in the midst of diseases that kill off whole peoples oh if such an one was to come from god and not the devil what a force for good might he not be in this old world of ours but we are pledged to set the world free our toil must be in silence and our efforts all in secret for in this enlightened age when men believe not even what they see the doubting of wise men would be his greatest strength it would be at once his sheath and his armour and his weapons to destroy us his enemies who are willing to peril even our own souls for the safety of one we love for the good of mankind and for the honour and glory of god after a general discussion it was determined that for to night nothing be definitely settled that we should all sleep on the facts and try to think out the proper conclusions to morrow at breakfast we are to meet again and after making our conclusions known to one another we shall decide on some definite cause of action i feel a wonderful peace and rest to night it is as if some haunting presence were removed from me perhaps my surmise was not finished could not be for i caught sight in the mirror of the red mark upon my forehead and i knew that i was still unclean dr seward s diary october we all rose early and i think that sleep did much for each and all of us when we met at early breakfast there was more general cheerfulness than any of us had ever expected to experience again it is really wonderful how much resilience there is in human nature let any obstructing cause no matter what be removed in any way even by death and we fly back to first principles of hope and enjoyment more than once as we sat around the table my eyes opened in wonder whether the whole of the past days had not been a dream it was only when i caught sight of the red blotch on mrs harker s forehead that i was brought back to reality even now when i am gravely revolving the matter it is almost impossible to realise that the cause of all our trouble is still existent even mrs harker seems to lose sight of her trouble for whole spells it is only now and again when something recalls it to her mind that she thinks of her terrible scar we are to meet here in my study in half an hour and decide on our course of action i see only one immediate difficulty i know it by instinct rather than reason we shall all have to speak frankly and yet i fear that in some mysterious way poor mrs harker s tongue is tied i know that she forms conclusions of her own and from all that has been i can guess how brilliant and how true they must be but she will not or cannot give them utterance i have mentioned this to van helsing and he and i are to talk it over when we are alone i suppose it is some of that horrid poison which has got into her veins beginning to work the count had his own purposes when he gave her what van helsing called the vampire s baptism of blood well there may be a poison that distils itself out of good things in an age when the existence of ptomaines is a mystery we should not wonder at anything one thing i know that if my instinct be true regarding poor mrs harker s silences then there is a terrible difficulty an unknown danger in the work before us the same power that compels her silence may compel her speech i dare not think further for so i should in my thoughts dishonour a noble woman van helsing is coming to my study a little before the others i shall try to open the subject with him later when the professor came in we talked over the state of things i could see that he had something on his mind which he wanted to say but felt some hesitancy about broaching the subject after beating about the bush a little he said suddenly friend john there is something that you and i must talk of alone just at the first at any rate later we may have to take the others into our confidence then he stopped so i waited he went on madam mina our poor dear madam mina is changing a cold shiver ran through me to find my worst fears thus endorsed van helsing continued with the sad experience of miss lucy we must this time be warned before things go too far our task is now in reality more difficult than ever and this new trouble makes every hour of the direst importance i can see the characteristics of the vampire coming in her face it is now but very very slight but it is to be seen if we have eyes to notice without to prejudge her teeth are some sharper and at times her eyes are more hard but these are not all there is to her the silence now often as so it was with miss lucy she did not speak even when she wrote that which she wished to be known later now my fear is this if it be that she can by our hypnotic trance tell what the count see and hear is it not more true that he who have hypnotise her first and who have drink of her very blood and make her drink of his should if he will compel her mind to disclose to him that which she know i nodded acquiescence he went on then what we must do is to prevent this we must keep her ignorant of our intent and so she cannot tell what she know not this is a painful task oh so painful that it heart break me to think of but it must be when to day we meet i must tell her that for reason which we will not to speak she must not more be of our council but be simply guarded by us he wiped his forehead which had broken out in profuse perspiration at the thought of the pain which he might have to inflict upon the poor soul already so tortured i knew that it would be some sort of comfort to him if i told him that i also had come to the same conclusion for at any rate it would take away the pain of doubt i told him and the effect was as i expected it is now close to the time of our general gathering van helsing has gone away to prepare for the meeting and his painful part of it i really believe his purpose is to be able to pray alone later at the very outset of our meeting a great personal relief was experienced by both van helsing and myself mrs harker had sent a message by her husband to say that she would not join us at present as she thought it better that we should be free to discuss our movements without her presence to embarrass us the professor and i looked at each other for an instant and somehow we both seemed relieved for my own part i thought that if mrs harker realised the danger herself it was much pain as well as much danger averted under the circumstances we agreed by a questioning look and answer with finger on lip to preserve silence in our suspicions until we should have been able to confer alone again we went at once into our plan of campaign van helsing roughly put the facts before us first the czarina catherine left the thames yesterday morning it will take her at the quickest speed she has ever made at least three weeks to reach varna but we can travel overland to the same place in three days now if we allow for two days less for the ship s voyage owing to such weather influences as we know that the count can bring to bear and if we allow a whole day and night for any delays which may occur to us then we have a margin of nearly two weeks thus in order to be quite safe we must leave here on th at latest then we shall at any rate be in varna a day before the ship arrives and able to make such preparations as may be necessary of course we shall all go armed armed against evil things spiritual as well as physical here quincey morris added i understand that the count comes from a wolf country and it may be that he shall get there before us i propose that we add winchesters to our armament i have a kind of belief in a winchester when there is any trouble of that sort around do you remember art when we had the pack after us at tobolsk what wouldn t we have given then for a repeater apiece good said van helsing winchesters it shall be quincey s head is level at all times but most so when there is to hunt metaphor be more dishonour to science than wolves be of danger to man in the meantime we can do nothing here and as i think that varna is not familiar to any of us why not go there more soon it is as long to wait here as there to night and to morrow we can get ready and then if all be well we four can set out on our journey we four said harker interrogatively looking from one to another of us of course answered the professor quickly you must remain to take care of your so sweet wife harker was silent for awhile and then said in a hollow voice let us talk of that part of it in the morning i want to consult with mina i thought that now was the time for van helsing to warn him not to disclose our plans to her but he took no notice i looked at him significantly and coughed for answer he put his finger on his lips and turned away jonathan harker s journal october afternoon for some time after our meeting this morning i could not think the new phases of things leave my mind in a state of wonder which allows no room for active thought mina s determination not to take any part in the discussion set me thinking and as i could not argue the matter with her i could only guess i am as far as ever from a solution now the way the others received it too puzzled me the last time we talked of the subject we agreed that there was to be no more concealment of anything amongst us mina is sleeping now calmly and sweetly like a little child her lips are curved and her face beams with happiness thank god there are such moments still for her later how strange it all is i sat watching mina s happy sleep and came as near to being happy myself as i suppose i shall ever be as the evening drew on and the earth took its shadows from the sun sinking lower the silence of the room grew more and more solemn to me all at once mina opened her eyes and looking at me tenderly said jonathan i want you to promise me something on your word of honour a promise made to me but made holily in god s hearing and not to be broken though i should go down on my knees and implore you with bitter tears quick you must make it to me at once mina i said a promise like that i cannot make at once i may have no right to make it but dear one she said with such spiritual intensity that her eyes were like pole stars it is i who wish it and it is not for myself you can ask dr van helsing if i am not right if he disagrees you may do as you will nay more if you all agree later you are absolved from the promise i promise i said and for a moment she looked supremely happy though to me all happiness for her was denied by the red scar on her forehead she said promise me that you will not tell me anything of the plans formed for the campaign against the count not by word or inference or implication not at any time whilst this remains to me and she solemnly pointed to the scar i saw that she was in earnest and said solemnly i promise and as i said it i felt that from that instant a door had been shut between us later midnight mina has been bright and cheerful all the evening so much so that all the rest seemed to take courage as if infected somewhat with her gaiety as a result even i myself felt as if the pall of gloom which weighs us down were somewhat lifted we all retired early mina is now sleeping like a little child it is a wonderful thing that her faculty of sleep remains to her in the midst of her terrible trouble thank god for it for then at least she can forget her care perhaps her example may affect me as her gaiety did to night i shall try it oh for a dreamless sleep october morning another surprise mina woke me early about the same time as yesterday and asked me to bring dr van helsing i thought that it was another occasion for hypnotism and without question went for the professor he had evidently expected some such call for i found him dressed in his room his door was ajar so that he could hear the opening of the door of our room he came at once as he passed into the room he asked mina if the others might come too no she said quite simply it will not be necessary you can tell them just as well i must go with you on your journey dr van helsing was as startled as i was after a moment s pause he asked but why you must take me with you i am safer with you and you shall be safer too but why dear madam mina you know that your safety is our solemnest duty we go into danger to which you are or may be more liable than any of us from from circumstances things that have been he paused embarrassed as she replied she raised her finger and pointed to her forehead i know that is why i must go i can tell you now whilst the sun is coming up i may not be able again i know that when the count wills me i must go i know that if he tells me to come in secret i must come by wile by any device to hoodwink even jonathan god saw the look that she turned on me as she spoke and if there be indeed a recording angel that look is noted to her everlasting honour i could only clasp her hand i could not speak my emotion was too great for even the relief of tears she went on you men are brave and strong you are strong in your numbers for you can defy that which would break down the human endurance of one who had to guard alone besides i may be of service since you can hypnotise me and so learn that which even i myself do not know dr van helsing said very gravely madam mina you are as always most wise you shall with us come and together we shall do that which we go forth to achieve when he had spoken mina s long spell of silence made me look at her she had fallen back on her pillow asleep she did not even wake when i had pulled up the blind and let in the sunlight which flooded the room van helsing motioned to me to come with him quietly we went to his room and within a minute lord godalming dr seward and mr morris were with us also he told them what mina had said and went on in the morning we shall leave for varna we have now to deal with a new factor madam mina oh but her soul is true it is to her an agony to tell us so much as she has done but it is most right and we are warned in time there must be no chance lost and in varna we must be ready to act the instant when that ship arrives what shall we do exactly asked mr morris laconically the professor paused before replying we shall at the first board that ship then when we have identified the box we shall place a branch of the wild rose on it this we shall fasten for when it is there none can emerge so at least says the superstition and to superstition must we trust at the first it was man s faith in the early and it have its root in faith still then when we get the opportunity that we seek when none are near to see we shall open the box and and all will be well i shall not wait for any opportunity said morris when i see the box i shall open it and destroy the monster though there were a thousand men looking on and if i am to be wiped out for it the next moment i grasped his hand instinctively and found it as firm as a piece of steel i think he understood my look i hope he did good boy said dr van helsing brave boy quincey is all man god bless him for it my child believe me none of us shall lag behind or pause from any fear i do but say what we may do what we must do but indeed indeed we cannot say what we shall do there are so many things which may happen and their ways and their ends are so various that until the moment we may not say we shall all be armed in all ways and when the time for the end has come our effort shall not be lack now let us to day put all our affairs in order let all things which touch on others dear to us and who on us depend be complete for none of us can tell what or when or how the end may be as for me my own affairs are regulate and as i have nothing else to do i shall go make arrangements for the travel i shall have all tickets and so forth for our journey there was nothing further to be said and we parted i shall now settle up all my affairs of earth and be ready for whatever may come later it is all done my will is made and all complete mina if she survive is my sole heir if it should not be so then the others who have been so good to us shall have remainder it is now drawing towards the sunset mina s uneasiness calls my attention to it i am sure that there is something on her mind which the time of exact sunset will reveal these occasions are becoming harrowing times for us all for each sunrise and sunset opens up some new danger some new pain which however may in god s will be means to a good end i write all these things in the diary since my darling must not hear them now but if it may be that she can see them again they shall be ready she is calling to me chapter xxv dr seward s diary october evening jonathan harker has asked me to note this as he says he is hardly equal to the task and he wants an exact record kept i think that none of us were surprised when we were asked to see mrs harker a little before the time of sunset we have of late come to understand that sunrise and sunset are to her times of peculiar freedom when her old self can be manifest without any controlling force subduing or restraining her or inciting her to action this mood or condition begins some half hour or more before actual sunrise or sunset and lasts till either the sun is high or whilst the clouds are still aglow with the rays streaming above the horizon at first there is a sort of negative condition as if some tie were loosened and then the absolute freedom quickly follows when however the freedom ceases the change back or relapse comes quickly preceded only by a spell of warning silence to night when we met she was somewhat constrained and bore all the signs of an internal struggle i put it down myself to her making a violent effort at the earliest instant she could do so a very few minutes however gave her complete control of herself then motioning her husband to sit beside her on the sofa where she was half reclining she made the rest of us bring chairs up close taking her husband s hand in hers began we are all here together in freedom for perhaps the last time i know dear i know that you will always be with me to the end this was to her husband whose hand had as we could see tightened upon hers in the morning we go out upon our task and god alone knows what may be in store for any of us you are going to be so good to me as to take me with you i know that all that brave earnest men can do for a poor weak woman whose soul perhaps is lost no no not yet but is at any rate at stake you will do but you must remember that i am not as you are there is a poison in my blood in my soul which may destroy me which must destroy me unless some relief comes to us oh my friends you know as well as i do that my soul is at stake and though i know there is one way out for me you must not and i must not take it she looked appealingly to us all in turn beginning and ending with her husband what is that way asked van helsing in a hoarse voice what is that way which we must not may not take that i may die now either by my own hand or that of another before the greater evil is entirely wrought i know and you know that were i once dead you could and would set free my immortal spirit even as you did my poor lucy s were death or the fear of death the only thing that stood in the way i would not shrink to die here now amidst the friends who love me but death is not all i cannot believe that to die in such a case when there is hope before us and a bitter task to be done is god s will therefore i on my part give up here the certainty of eternal rest and go out into the dark where may be the blackest things that the world or the nether world holds we were all silent for we knew instinctively that this was only a prelude the faces of the others were set and harker s grew ashen grey perhaps he guessed better than any of us what was coming she continued this is what i can give into the hotch pot i could not but note the quaint legal phrase which she used in such a place and with all seriousness what will each of you give your lives i know she went on quickly that is easy for brave men your lives are god s and you can give them back to him but what will you give to me she looked again questioningly but this time avoided her husband s face quincey seemed to understand he nodded and her face lit up then i shall tell you plainly what i want for there must be no doubtful matter in this connection between us now you must promise me one and all even you my beloved husband that should the time come you will kill me what is that time the voice was quincey s but it was low and strained when you shall be convinced that i am so changed that it is better that i die than i may live when i am thus dead in the flesh then you will without a moment s delay drive a stake through me and cut off my head or do whatever else may be wanting to give me rest quincey was the first to rise after the pause he knelt down before her and taking her hand in his said solemnly i m only a rough fellow who hasn t perhaps lived as a man should to win such a distinction but i swear to you by all that i hold sacred and dear that should the time ever come i shall not flinch from the duty that you have set us and i promise you too that i shall make all certain for if i am only doubtful i shall take it that the time has come my true friend was all she could say amid her fast falling tears as bending over she kissed his hand i swear the same my dear madam mina said van helsing and i said lord godalming each of them in turn kneeling to her to take the oath i followed myself then her husband turned to her wan eyed and with a greenish pallor which subdued the snowy whiteness of his hair and asked and must i too make such a promise oh my wife you too my dearest she said with infinite yearning of pity in her voice and eyes you must not shrink you are nearest and dearest and all the world to me our souls are knit into one for all life and all time think dear that there have been times when brave men have killed their wives and their womenkind to keep them from falling into the hands of the enemy their hands did not falter any the more because those that they loved implored them to slay them it is men s duty towards those whom they love in such times of sore trial and oh my dear if it is to be that i must meet death at any hand let it be at the hand of him that loves me best dr van helsing i have not forgotten your mercy in poor lucy s case to him who loved she stopped with a flying blush and changed her phrase to him who had best right to give her peace if that time shall come again i look to you to make it a happy memory of my husband s life that it was his loving hand which set me free from the awful thrall upon me again i swear came the professor s resonant voice mrs harker smiled positively smiled as with a sigh of relief she leaned back and said and now one word of warning a warning which you must never forget this time if it ever come may come quickly and unexpectedly and in such case you must lose no time in using your opportunity at such a time i myself might be nay if the time ever comes shall be leagued with your enemy against you one more request she became very solemn as she said this it is not vital and necessary like the other but i want you to do one thing for me if you will we all acquiesced but no one spoke there was no need to speak i want you to read the burial service she was interrupted by a deep groan from her husband taking his hand in hers she held it over her heart and continued you must read it over me some day whatever may be the issue of all this fearful state of things it will be a sweet thought to all or some of us you my dearest will i hope read it for then it will be in your voice in my memory for ever come what may but oh my dear one he pleaded death is afar off from you nay she said holding up a warning hand i am deeper in death at this moment than if the weight of an earthly grave lay heavy upon me oh my wife must i read it he said before he began it would comfort me my husband was all she said and he began to read when she had got the book ready how can i how could any one tell of that strange scene its solemnity its gloom its sadness its horror and withal its sweetness even a sceptic who can see nothing but a travesty of bitter truth in anything holy or emotional would have been melted to the heart had he seen that little group of loving and devoted friends kneeling round that stricken and sorrowing lady or heard the tender passion of her husband s voice as in tones so broken with emotion that often he had to pause he read the simple and beautiful service from the burial of the dead i i cannot go on words and v voice f fail m me she was right in her instinct strange as it all was bizarre as it may hereafter seem even to us who felt its potent influence at the time it comforted us much and the silence which showed mrs harker s coming relapse from her freedom of soul did not seem so full of despair to any of us as we had dreaded jonathan harker s journal october varna we left charing cross on the morning of the th got to paris the same night and took the places secured for us in the orient express we travelled night and day arriving here at about five o clock lord godalming went to the consulate to see if any telegram had arrived for him whilst the rest of us came on to this hotel the odessus the journey may have had incidents i was however too eager to get on to care for them until the czarina catherine comes into port there will be no interest for me in anything in the wide world thank god mina is well and looks to be getting stronger her colour is coming back she sleeps a great deal throughout the journey she slept nearly all the time before sunrise and sunset however she is very wakeful and alert and it has become a habit for van helsing to hypnotise her at such times at first some effort was needed and he had to make many passes but now she seems to yield at once as if by habit and scarcely any action is needed he seems to have power at these particular moments to simply will and her thoughts obey him he always asks her what she can see and hear she answers to the first nothing all is dark and to the second i can hear the waves lapping against the ship and the water rushing by canvas and cordage strain and masts and yards creak the wind is high i can hear it in the shrouds and the bow throws back the foam it is evident that the czarina catherine is still at sea hastening on her way to varna lord godalming has just returned he had four telegrams one each day since we started and all to the same effect that the czarina catherine had not been reported to lloyd s from anywhere he had arranged before leaving london that his agent should send him every day a telegram saying if the ship had been reported he was to have a message even if she were not reported so that he might be sure that there was a watch being kept at the other end of the wire we had dinner and went to bed early to morrow we are to see the vice consul and to arrange if we can about getting on board the ship as soon as she arrives van helsing says that our chance will be to get on the boat between sunrise and sunset the count even if he takes the form of a bat cannot cross the running water of his own volition and so cannot leave the ship as he dare not change to man s form without suspicion which he evidently wishes to avoid he must remain in the box if then we can come on board after sunrise he is at our mercy for we can open the box and make sure of him as we did of poor lucy before he wakes what mercy he shall get from us will not count for much we think that we shall not have much trouble with officials or the seamen thank god this is the country where bribery can do anything and we are well supplied with money we have only to make sure that the ship cannot come into port between sunset and sunrise without our being warned and we shall be safe judge moneybag will settle this case i think october mina s report still the same lapping waves and rushing water darkness and favouring winds we are evidently in good time and when we hear of the czarina catherine we shall be ready as she must pass the dardanelles we are sure to have some report october everything is pretty well fixed now i think to welcome the count on his return from his tour godalming told the shippers that he fancied that the box sent aboard might contain something stolen from a friend of his and got a half consent that he might open it at his own risk the owner gave him a paper telling the captain to give him every facility in doing whatever he chose on board the ship and also a similar authorisation to his agent at varna we have seen the agent who was much impressed with godalming s kindly manner to him and we are all satisfied that whatever he can do to aid our wishes will be done we have already arranged what to do in case we get the box open if the count is there van helsing and seward will cut off his head at once and drive a stake through his heart morris and godalming and i shall prevent interference even if we have to use the arms which we shall have ready the professor says that if we can so treat the count s body it will soon after fall into dust in such case there would be no evidence against us in case any suspicion of murder were aroused but even if it were not we should stand or fall by our act and perhaps some day this very script may be evidence to come between some of us and a rope for myself i should take the chance only too thankfully if it were to come we mean to leave no stone unturned to carry out our intent we have arranged with certain officials that the instant the czarina catherine is seen we are to be informed by a special messenger october a whole week of waiting daily telegrams to godalming but only the same story not yet reported mina s morning and evening hypnotic answer is unvaried lapping waves rushing water and creaking masts telegram october th rufus smith lloyd s london to lord godalming care of h b m vice consul varna czarina catherine reported this morning from dardanelles dr seward s diary october how i miss my phonograph to write diary with a pen is irksome to me but van helsing says i must we were all wild with excitement yesterday when godalming got his telegram from lloyd s i know now what men feel in battle when the call to action is heard mrs harker alone of our party did not show any signs of emotion after all it is not strange that she did not for we took special care not to let her know anything about it and we all tried not to show any excitement when we were in her presence in old days she would i am sure have noticed no matter how we might have tried to conceal it but in this way she is greatly changed during the past three weeks the lethargy grows upon her and though she seems strong and well and is getting back some of her colour van helsing and i are not satisfied we talk of her often we have not however said a word to the others it would break poor harker s heart certainly his nerve if he knew that we had even a suspicion on the subject van helsing examines he tells me her teeth very carefully whilst she is in the hypnotic condition for he says that so long as they do not begin to sharpen there is no active danger of a change in her if this change should come it would be necessary to take steps we both know what those steps would have to be though we do not mention our thoughts to each other we should neither of us shrink from the task awful though it be to contemplate euthanasia is an excellent and a comforting word i am grateful to whoever invented it it is only about hours sail from the dardanelles to here at the rate the czarina catherine has come from london she should therefore arrive some time in the morning but as she cannot possibly get in before then we are all about to retire early we shall get up at one o clock so as to be ready october noon no news yet of the ship s arrival mrs harker s hypnotic report this morning was the same as usual so it is possible that we may get news at any moment we men are all in a fever of excitement except harker who is calm his hands are cold as ice and an hour ago i found him whetting the edge of the great ghoorka knife which he now always carries with him it will be a bad lookout for the count if the edge of that kukri ever touches his throat driven by that stern ice cold hand van helsing and i were a little alarmed about mrs harker to day about noon she got into a sort of lethargy which we did not like although we kept silence to the others we were neither of us happy about it she had been restless all the morning so that we were at first glad to know that she was sleeping when however her husband mentioned casually that she was sleeping so soundly that he could not wake her we went to her room to see for ourselves she was breathing naturally and looked so well and peaceful that we agreed that the sleep was better for her than anything else poor girl she has so much to forget that it is no wonder that sleep if it brings oblivion to her does her good later our opinion was justified for when after a refreshing sleep of some hours she woke up she seemed brighter and better than she had been for days at sunset she made the usual hypnotic report wherever he may be in the black sea the count is hurrying to his destination to his doom i trust october another day and no tidings of the czarina catherine she ought to be here by now that she is still journeying somewhere is apparent for mrs harker s hypnotic report at sunrise was still the same it is possible that the vessel may be lying by at times for fog some of the steamers which came in last evening reported patches of fog both to north and south of the port we must continue our watching as the ship may now be signalled any moment october noon most strange no news yet of the ship we wait for mrs harker reported last night and this morning as usual lapping waves and rushing water though she added that the waves were very faint the telegrams from london have been the same no further report van helsing is terribly anxious and told me just now that he fears the count is escaping us he added significantly i did not like that lethargy of madam mina s souls and memories can do strange things during trance i was about to ask him more but harker just then came in and he held up a warning hand we must try to night at sunset to make her speak more fully when in her hypnotic state october telegram rufus smith london to lord godalming care h b m vice consul varna czarina catherine reported entering galatz at one o clock to day dr seward s diary october when the telegram came announcing the arrival in galatz i do not think it was such a shock to any of us as might have been expected true we did not know whence or how or when the bolt would come but i think we all expected that something strange would happen the delay of arrival at varna made us individually satisfied that things would not be just as we had expected we only waited to learn where the change would occur none the less however was it a surprise i suppose that nature works on such a hopeful basis that we believe against ourselves that things will be as they ought to be not as we should know that they will be transcendentalism is a beacon to the angels even if it be a will o the wisp to man it was an odd experience and we all took it differently van helsing raised his hand over his head for a moment as though in remonstrance with the almighty but he said not a word and in a few seconds stood up with his face sternly set lord godalming grew very pale and sat breathing heavily i was myself half stunned and looked in wonder at one after another quincey morris tightened his belt with that quick movement which i knew so well in our old wandering days it meant action mrs harker grew ghastly white so that the scar on her forehead seemed to burn but she folded her hands meekly and looked up in prayer harker smiled actually smiled the dark bitter smile of one who is without hope but at the same time his action belied his words for his hands instinctively sought the hilt of the great kukri knife and rested there when does the next train start for galatz said van helsing to us generally at to morrow morning we all started for the answer came from mrs harker how on earth do you know said art you forget or perhaps you do not know though jonathan does and so does dr van helsing that i am the train fiend at home in exeter i always used to make up the time tables so as to be helpful to my husband i found it so useful sometimes that i always make a study of the time tables now i knew that if anything were to take us to castle dracula we should go by galatz or at any rate through bucharest so i learned the times very carefully unhappily there are not many to learn as the only train to morrow leaves as i say wonderful woman murmured the professor can t we get a special asked lord godalming van helsing shook his head i fear not this land is very different from yours or mine even if we did have a special it would probably not arrive as soon as our regular train moreover we have something to prepare we must think now let us organize you friend arthur go to the train and get the tickets and arrange that all be ready for us to go in the morning do you friend jonathan go to the agent of the ship and get from him letters to the agent in galatz with authority to make search the ship just as it was here morris quincey you see the vice consul and get his aid with his fellow in galatz and all he can do to make our way smooth so that no times be lost when over the danube john will stay with madam mina and me and we shall consult for so if time be long you may be delayed and it will not matter when the sun set since i am here with madam to make report and i said mrs harker brightly and more like her old self than she had been for many a long day shall try to be of use in all ways and shall think and write for you as i used to do something is shifting from me in some strange way and i feel freer than i have been of late the three younger men looked happier at the moment as they seemed to realise the significance of her words but van helsing and i turning to each other met each a grave and troubled glance we said nothing at the time however when the three men had gone out to their tasks van helsing asked mrs harker to look up the copy of the diaries and find him the part of harker s journal at the castle she went away to get it when the door was shut upon her he said to me we mean the same speak out there is some change it is a hope that makes me sick for it may deceive us quite so do you know why i asked her to get the manuscript no said i unless it was to get an opportunity of seeing me alone you are in part right friend john but only in part i want to tell you something and oh my friend i am taking a great a terrible risk but i believe it is right in the moment when madam mina said those words that arrest both our understanding an inspiration came to me in the trance of three days ago the count sent her his spirit to read her mind or more like he took her to see him in his earth box in the ship with water rushing just as it go free at rise and set of sun he learn then that we are here for she have more to tell in her open life with eyes to see and ears to hear than he shut as he is in his coffin box now he make his most effort to escape us at present he want her not he is sure with his so great knowledge that she will come at his call but he cut her off take her as he can do out of his own power that so she come not to him ah there i have hope that our man brains that have been of man so long and that have not lost the grace of god will come higher than his child brain that lie in his tomb for centuries that grow not yet to our stature and that do only work selfish and therefore small here comes madam mina not a word to her of her trance she know it not and it would overwhelm her and make despair just when we want all her hope all her courage when most we want all her great brain which is trained like man s brain but is of sweet woman and have a special power which the count give her and which he may not take away altogether though he think not so hush let me speak and you shall learn oh john my friend we are in awful straits i fear as i never feared before we can only trust the good god silence here she comes i thought that the professor was going to break down and have hysterics just as he had when lucy died but with a great effort he controlled himself and was at perfect nervous poise when mrs harker tripped into the room bright and happy looking and in the doing of work seemingly forgetful of her misery as she came in she handed a number of sheets of typewriting to van helsing he looked over them gravely his face brightening up as he read then holding the pages between his finger and thumb he said friend john to you with so much of experience already and you too dear madam mina that are young here is a lesson do not fear ever to think a half thought has been buzzing often in my brain but i fear to let him loose his wings here now with more knowledge i go back to where that half thought come from and i find that he be no half thought at all that be a whole thought though so young that he is not yet strong to use his little wings nay like the ugly duck of my friend hans andersen he be no duck thought at all but a big swan thought that sail nobly on big wings when the time come for him to try them see i read here what jonathan have written that other of his race who in a later age again and again brought his forces over the great river into turkey land who when he was beaten back came again and again and again though he had to come alone from the bloody field where his troops were being slaughtered since he knew that he alone could ultimately triumph what does this tell us not much no the count s child thought see nothing therefore he speak so free your man thought see nothing my man thought see nothing till just now no but there comes another word from some one who speak without thought because she too know not what it mean what it might mean just as there are elements which rest yet when in nature s course they move on their way and they touch then pouf and there comes a flash of light heaven wide that blind and kill and destroy some but that show up all earth below for leagues and leagues is it not so well i shall explain to begin have you ever study the philosophy of crime yes and no you john yes for it is a study of insanity you no madam mina for crime touch you not not but once still your mind works true and argues not a particulari ad universale there is this peculiarity in criminals it is so constant in all countries and at all times that even police who know not much from philosophy come to know it empirically that it is that is to be empiric the criminal always work at one crime that is the true criminal who seems predestinate to crime and who will of none other this criminal has not full man brain he is clever and cunning and resourceful but he be not of man stature as to brain he be of child brain in much now this criminal of ours is predestinate to crime also he too have child brain and it is of the child to do what he have done the little bird the little fish the little animal learn not by principle but empirically and when he learn to do then there is to him the ground to start from to do more dos pou sto said archimedes give me a fulcrum and i shall move the world to do once is the fulcrum whereby child brain become man brain and until he have the purpose to do more he continue to do the same again every time just as he have done before oh my dear i see that your eyes are opened and that to you the lightning flash show all the leagues for mrs harker began to clap her hands and her eyes sparkled he went on now you shall speak tell us two dry men of science what you see with those so bright eyes he took her hand and held it whilst she spoke his finger and thumb closed on her pulse as i thought instinctively and unconsciously as she spoke the count is a criminal and of criminal type nordau and lombroso would so classify him and qu criminal he is of imperfectly formed mind thus in a difficulty he has to seek resource in habit his past is a clue and the one page of it that we know and that from his own lips tells that once before when in what mr morris would call a tight place he went back to his own country from the land he had tried to invade and thence without losing purpose prepared himself for a new effort he came again better equipped for his work and won so he came to london to invade a new land he was beaten and when all hope of success was lost and his existence in danger he fled back over the sea to his home just as formerly he had fled back over the danube from turkey land good good oh you so clever lady said van helsing enthusiastically as he stooped and kissed her hand a moment later he said to me as calmly as though we had been having a sick room consultation seventy two only and in all this excitement i have hope turning to her again he said with keen expectation but go on go on there is more to tell if you will be not afraid john and i know i do in any case and shall tell you if you are right speak without fear i will try to but you will forgive me if i seem egotistical nay fear not you must be egotist for it is of you that we think then as he is criminal he is selfish and as his intellect is small and his action is based on selfishness he confines himself to one purpose that purpose is remorseless as he fled back over the danube leaving his forces to be cut to pieces so now he is intent on being safe careless of all so his own selfishness frees my soul somewhat from the terrible power which he acquired over me on that dreadful night i felt it oh i felt it thank god for his great mercy my soul is freer than it has been since that awful hour and all that haunts me is a fear lest in some trance or dream he may have used my knowledge for his ends the professor stood up he has so used your mind and by it he has left us here in varna whilst the ship that carried him rushed through enveloping fog up to galatz where doubtless he had made preparation for escaping from us but his child mind only saw so far and it may be that as ever is in god s providence the very thing that the evil doer most reckoned on for his selfish good turns out to be his chiefest harm the hunter is taken in his own snare as the great psalmist says for now that he think he is free from every trace of us all and that he has escaped us with so many hours to him then his selfish child brain will whisper him to sleep he think too that as he cut himself off from knowing your mind there can be no knowledge of him to you there is where he fail that terrible baptism of blood which he give you makes you free to go to him in spirit as you have as yet done in your times of freedom when the sun rise and set at such times you go by my volition and not by his and this power to good of you and others as you have won from your suffering at his hands this is now all the more precious that he know it not and to guard himself have even cut himself off from his knowledge of our where we however are not selfish and we believe that god is with us through all this blackness and these many dark hours we shall follow him and we shall not flinch even if we peril ourselves that we become like him friend john this has been a great hour and it have done much to advance us on our way you must be scribe and write him all down so that when the others return from their work you can give it to them then they shall know as we do and so i have written it whilst we wait their return and mrs harker has written with her typewriter all since she brought the ms to us chapter xxvi dr seward s diary october this is written in the train from varna to galatz last night we all assembled a little before the time of sunset each of us had done his work as well as he could so far as thought and endeavour and opportunity go we are prepared for the whole of our journey and for our work when we get to galatz when the usual time came round mrs harker prepared herself for her hypnotic effort and after a longer and more serious effort on the part of van helsing than has been usually necessary she sank into the trance usually she speaks on a hint but this time the professor had to ask her questions and to ask them pretty resolutely before we could learn anything at last her answer came i can see nothing we are still there are no waves lapping but only a steady swirl of water softly running against the hawser i can hear men s voices calling near and far and the roll and creak of oars in the rowlocks a gun is fired somewhere the echo of it seems far away there is tramping of feet overhead and ropes and chains are dragged along what is this there is a gleam of light i can feel the air blowing upon me here she stopped she had risen as if impulsively from where she lay on the sofa and raised both her hands palms upwards as if lifting a weight van helsing and i looked at each other with understanding quincey raised his eyebrows slightly and looked at her intently whilst harker s hand instinctively closed round the hilt of his kukri there was a long pause we all knew that the time when she could speak was passing but we felt that it was useless to say anything suddenly she sat up and as she opened her eyes said sweetly would none of you like a cup of tea you must all be so tired we could only make her happy and so acquiesced she bustled off to get tea when she had gone van helsing said you see my friends he is close to land he has left his earth chest but he has yet to get on shore in the night he may lie hidden somewhere but if he be not carried on shore or if the ship do not touch it he cannot achieve the land in such case he can if it be in the night change his form and can jump or fly on shore as he did at whitby but if the day come before he get on shore then unless he be carried he cannot escape and if he be carried then the customs men may discover what the box contain thus in fine if he escape not on shore to night or before dawn there will be the whole day lost to him we may then arrive in time for if he escape not at night we shall come on him in daytime boxed up and at our mercy for he dare not be his true self awake and visible lest he be discovered there was no more to be said so we waited in patience until the dawn at which time we might learn more from mrs harker early this morning we listened with breathless anxiety for her response in her trance the hypnotic stage was even longer in coming than before and when it came the time remaining until full sunrise was so short that we began to despair van helsing seemed to throw his whole soul into the effort at last in obedience to his will she made reply all is dark i hear lapping water level with me and some creaking as of wood on wood she paused and the red sun shot up we must wait till to night and so it is that we are travelling towards galatz in an agony of expectation we are due to arrive between two and three in the morning but already at bucharest we are three hours late so we cannot possibly get in till well after sun up thus we shall have two more hypnotic messages from mrs harker either or both may possibly throw more light on what is happening later sunset has come and gone fortunately it came at a time when there was no distraction for had it occurred whilst we were at a station we might not have secured the necessary calm and isolation mrs harker yielded to the hypnotic influence even less readily than this morning i am in fear that her power of reading the count s sensations may die away just when we want it most it seems to me that her imagination is beginning to work whilst she has been in the trance hitherto she has confined herself to the simplest of facts if this goes on it may ultimately mislead us if i thought that the count s power over her would die away equally with her power of knowledge it would be a happy thought but i am afraid that it may not be so when she did speak her words were enigmatical something is going out i can feel it pass me like a cold wind i can hear far off confused sounds as of men talking in strange tongues fierce falling water and the howling of wolves she stopped and a shudder ran through her increasing in intensity for a few seconds till at the end she shook as though in a palsy she said no more even in answer to the professor s imperative questioning when she woke from the trance she was cold and exhausted and languid but her mind was all alert she could not remember anything but asked what she had said when she was told she pondered over it deeply for a long time and in silence october a m we are near galatz now and i may not have time to write later sunrise this morning was anxiously looked for by us all knowing of the increasing difficulty of procuring the hypnotic trance van helsing began his passes earlier than usual they produced no effect however until the regular time when she yielded with a still greater difficulty only a minute before the sun rose the professor lost no time in his questioning her answer came with equal quickness all is dark i hear water swirling by level with my ears and the creaking of wood on wood cattle low far off there is another sound a queer one like she stopped and grew white and whiter still go on go on speak i command you said van helsing in an agonised voice at the same time there was despair in his eyes for the risen sun was reddening even mrs harker s pale face she opened her eyes and we all started as she said sweetly and seemingly with the utmost unconcern oh professor why ask me to do what you know i can t i don t remember anything then seeing the look of amazement on our faces she said turning from one to the other with a troubled look what have i said what have i done i know nothing only that i was lying here half asleep and heard you say go on speak i command you it seemed so funny to hear you order me about as if i were a bad child oh madam mina he said sadly it is proof if proof be needed of how i love and honour you when a word for your good spoken more earnest than ever can seem so strange because it is to order her whom i am proud to obey the whistles are sounding we are nearing galatz we are on fire with anxiety and eagerness mina harker s journal october mr morris took me to the hotel where our rooms had been ordered by telegraph he being the one who could best be spared since he does not speak any foreign language the forces were distributed much as they had been at varna except that lord godalming went to the vice consul as his rank might serve as an immediate guarantee of some sort to the official we being in extreme hurry jonathan and the two doctors went to the shipping agent to learn particulars of the arrival of the czarina catherine later lord godalming has returned the consul is away and the vice consul sick so the routine work has been attended to by a clerk he was very obliging and offered to do anything in his power jonathan harker s journal october at nine o clock dr van helsing dr seward and i called on messrs mackenzie steinkoff the agents of the london firm of hapgood they had received a wire from london in answer to lord godalming s telegraphed request asking us to show them any civility in their power they were more than kind and courteous and took us at once on board the czarina catherine which lay at anchor out in the river harbour there we saw the captain donelson by name who told us of his voyage he said that in all his life he had never had so favourable a run man he said but it made us afeard for we expeckit that we should have to pay for it wi some rare piece o ill luck so as to keep up the average it s no canny to run frae london to the black sea wi a wind ahint ye as though the deil himself were blawin on yer sail for his ain purpose an a the time we could no speer a thing gin we were nigh a ship or a port or a headland a fog fell on us and travelled wi us till when after it had lifted and we looked out the deil a thing could we see we ran by gibraltar wi oot bein able to signal an till we came to the dardanelles and had to wait to get our permit to pass we never were within hail o aught at first i inclined to slack off sail and beat about till the fog was lifted but whiles i thocht that if the deil was minded to get us into the black sea quick he was like to do it whether we would or no if we had a quick voyage it would be no to our miscredit wi the owners or no hurt to our traffic an the old mon who had served his ain purpose wad be decently grateful to us for no hinderin him this mixture of simplicity and cunning of superstition and commercial reasoning aroused van helsing who said mine friend that devil is more clever than he is thought by some and he know when he meet his match the skipper was not displeased with the compliment and went on when we got past the bosphorus the men began to grumble some o them the roumanians came and asked me to heave overboard a big box which had been put on board by a queer lookin old man just before we had started frae london i had seen them speer at the fellow and put out their twa fingers when they saw him to guard against the evil eye man but the supersteetion of foreigners is pairfectly rideeculous i sent them aboot their business pretty quick but as just after a fog closed in on us i felt a wee bit as they did anent something though i wouldn t say it was agin the big box well on we went and as the fog didn t let up for five days i joost let the wind carry us for if the deil wanted to get somewheres well he would fetch it up a reet an if he didn t well we d keep a sharp lookout anyhow sure eneuch we had a fair way and deep water all the time and two days ago when the mornin sun came through the fog we found ourselves just in the river opposite galatz the roumanians were wild and wanted me right or wrong to take out the box and fling it in the river i had to argy wi them aboot it wi a handspike an when the last o them rose off the deck wi his head in his hand i had convinced them that evil eye or no evil eye the property and the trust of my owners were better in my hands than in the river danube they had mind ye taken the box on the deck ready to fling in and as it was marked galatz via varna i thocht i d let it lie till we discharged in the port an get rid o t althegither we didn t do much clearin that day an had to remain the nicht at anchor but in the mornin braw an airly an hour before sun up a man came aboard wi an order written to him from england to receive a box marked for one count dracula sure eneuch the matter was one ready to his hand he had his papers a reet an glad i was to be rid o the dam thing for i was beginnin masel to feel uneasy at it if the deil did have any luggage aboord the ship i m thinkin it was nane ither than that same what was the name of the man who took it asked dr van helsing with restrained eagerness i ll be tellin ye quick he answered and stepping down to his cabin produced a receipt signed immanuel hildesheim burgen strasse was the address we found out that this was all the captain knew so with thanks we came away we found hildesheim in his office a hebrew of rather the adelphi theatre type with a nose like a sheep and a fez his arguments were pointed with specie we doing the punctuation and with a little bargaining he told us what he knew this turned out to be simple but important he had received a letter from mr de ville of london telling him to receive if possible before sunrise so as to avoid customs a box which would arrive at galatz in the czarina catherine this he was to give in charge to a certain petrof skinsky who dealt with the slovaks who traded down the river to the port he had been paid for his work by an english bank note which had been duly cashed for gold at the danube international bank when skinsky had come to him he had taken him to the ship and handed over the box so as to save porterage that was all he knew we then sought for skinsky but were unable to find him one of his neighbours who did not seem to bear him any affection said that he had gone away two days before no one knew whither this was corroborated by his landlord who had received by messenger the key of the house together with the rent due in english money this had been between ten and eleven o clock last night we were at a standstill again whilst we were talking one came running and breathlessly gasped out that the body of skinsky had been found inside the wall of the churchyard of st peter and that the throat had been torn open as if by some wild animal those we had been speaking with ran off to see the horror the women crying out this is the work of a slovak we hurried away lest we should have been in some way drawn into the affair and so detained as we came home we could arrive at no definite conclusion we were all convinced that the box was on its way by water to somewhere but where that might be we would have to discover with heavy hearts we came home to the hotel to mina when we met together the first thing was to consult as to taking mina again into our confidence things are getting desperate and it is at least a chance though a hazardous one as a preliminary step i was released from my promise to her mina harker s journal october evening they were so tired and worn out and dispirited that there was nothing to be done till they had some rest so i asked them all to lie down for half an hour whilst i should enter everything up to the moment i feel so grateful to the man who invented the traveller s typewriter and to mr morris for getting this one for me i should have felt quite astray doing the work if i had to write with a pen it is all done poor dear dear jonathan what he must have suffered what must he be suffering now he lies on the sofa hardly seeming to breathe and his whole body appears in collapse his brows are knit his face is drawn with pain poor fellow maybe he is thinking and i can see his face all wrinkled up with the concentration of his thoughts oh if i could only help at all i shall do what i can i have asked dr van helsing and he has got me all the papers that i have not yet seen whilst they are resting i shall go over all carefully and perhaps i may arrive at some conclusion i shall try to follow the professor s example and think without prejudice on the facts before me i do believe that under god s providence i have made a discovery i shall get the maps and look over them i am more than ever sure that i am right my new conclusion is ready so i shall get our party together and read it they can judge it it is well to be accurate and every minute is precious mina harker s memorandum entered in her journal ground of inquiry count dracula s problem is to get back to his own place a he must be brought back by some one this is evident for had he power to move himself as he wished he could go either as man or wolf or bat or in some other way he evidently fears discovery or interference in the state of helplessness in which he must be confined as he is between dawn and sunset in his wooden box b how is he to be taken here a process of exclusions may help us by road by rail by water by road there are endless difficulties especially in leaving the city x there are people and people are curious and investigate a hint a surmise a doubt as to what might be in the box would destroy him y there are or there may be customs and octroi officers to pass z his pursuers might follow this is his highest fear and in order to prevent his being betrayed he has repelled so far as he can even his victim me by rail there is no one in charge of the box it would have to take its chance of being delayed and delay would be fatal with enemies on the track true he might escape at night but what would he be if left in a strange place with no refuge that he could fly to this is not what he intends and he does not mean to risk it by water here is the safest way in one respect but with most danger in another on the water he is powerless except at night even then he can only summon fog and storm and snow and his wolves but were he wrecked the living water would engulf him helpless and he would indeed be lost he could have the vessel drive to land but if it were unfriendly land wherein he was not free to move his position would still be desperate we know from the record that he was on the water so what we have to do is to ascertain what water the first thing is to realise exactly what he has done as yet we may then get a light on what his later task is to be firstly we must differentiate between what he did in london as part of his general plan of action when he was pressed for moments and had to arrange as best he could secondly we must see as well as we can surmise it from the facts we know of what he has done here as to the first he evidently intended to arrive at galatz and sent invoice to varna to deceive us lest we should ascertain his means of exit from england his immediate and sole purpose then was to escape the proof of this is the letter of instructions sent to immanuel hildesheim to clear and take away the box before sunrise there is also the instruction to petrof skinsky these we must only guess at but there must have been some letter or message since skinsky came to hildesheim that so far his plans were successful we know the czarina catherine made a phenomenally quick journey so much so that captain donelson s suspicions were aroused but his superstition united with his canniness played the count s game for him and he ran with his favouring wind through fogs and all till he brought up blindfold at galatz that the count s arrangements were well made has been proved hildesheim cleared the box took it off and gave it to skinsky skinsky took it and here we lose the trail we only know that the box is somewhere on the water moving along the customs and the octroi if there be any have been avoided now we come to what the count must have done after his arrival on land at galatz the box was given to skinsky before sunrise at sunrise the count could appear in his own form here we ask why skinsky was chosen at all to aid in the work in my husband s diary skinsky is mentioned as dealing with the slovaks who trade down the river to the port and the man s remark that the murder was the work of a slovak showed the general feeling against his class the count wanted isolation my surmise is this that in london the count decided to get back to his castle by water as the most safe and secret way he was brought from the castle by szgany and probably they delivered their cargo to slovaks who took the boxes to varna for there they were shipped for london thus the count had knowledge of the persons who could arrange this service when the box was on land before sunrise or after sunset he came out from his box met skinsky and instructed him what to do as to arranging the carriage of the box up some river when this was done and he knew that all was in train he blotted out his traces as he thought by murdering his agent i have examined the map and find that the river most suitable for the slovaks to have ascended is either the pruth or the sereth i read in the typescript that in my trance i heard cows low and water swirling level with my ears and the creaking of wood the count in his box then was on a river in an open boat propelled probably either by oars or poles for the banks are near and it is working against stream there would be no such sound if floating down stream of course it may not be either the sereth or the pruth but we may possibly investigate further now of these two the pruth is the more easily navigated but the sereth is at fundu joined by the bistritza which runs up round the borgo pass the loop it makes is manifestly as close to dracula s castle as can be got by water mina harker s journal continued when i had done reading jonathan took me in his arms and kissed me the others kept shaking me by both hands and dr van helsing said our dear madam mina is once more our teacher her eyes have been where we were blinded now we are on the track once again and this time we may succeed our enemy is at his most helpless and if we can come on him by day on the water our task will be over he has a start but he is powerless to hasten as he may not leave his box lest those who carry him may suspect for them to suspect would be to prompt them to throw him in the stream where he perish this he knows and will not now men to our council of war for here and now we must plan what each and all shall do i shall get a steam launch and follow him said lord godalming and i horses to follow on the bank lest by chance he land said mr morris good said the professor both good but neither must go alone there must be force to overcome force if need be the slovak is strong and rough and he carries rude arms all the men smiled for amongst them they carried a small arsenal said mr morris i have brought some winchesters they are pretty handy in a crowd and there may be wolves the count if you remember took some other precautions he made some requisitions on others that mrs harker could not quite hear or understand we must be ready at all points dr seward said i think i had better go with quincey we have been accustomed to hunt together and we two well armed will be a match for whatever may come along you must not be alone art it may be necessary to fight the slovaks and a chance thrust for i don t suppose these fellows carry guns would undo all our plans there must be no chances this time we shall not rest until the count s head and body have been separated and we are sure that he cannot re incarnate he looked at jonathan as he spoke and jonathan looked at me i could see that the poor dear was torn about in his mind of course he wanted to be with me but then the boat service would most likely be the one which would destroy the the the vampire why did i hesitate to write the word he was silent awhile and during his silence dr van helsing spoke friend jonathan this is to you for twice reasons first because you are young and brave and can fight and all energies may be needed at the last and again that it is your right to destroy him that which has wrought such woe to you and yours be not afraid for madam mina she will be my care if i may i am old my legs are not so quick to run as once and i am not used to ride so long or to pursue as need be or to fight with lethal weapons but i can be of other service i can fight in other way and i can die if need be as well as younger men now let me say that what i would is this while you my lord godalming and friend jonathan go in your so swift little steamboat up the river and whilst john and quincey guard the bank where perchance he might be landed i will take madam mina right into the heart of the enemy s country whilst the old fox is tied in his box floating on the running stream whence he cannot escape to land where he dares not raise the lid of his coffin box lest his slovak carriers should in fear leave him to perish we shall go in the track where jonathan went from bistritz over the borgo and find our way to the castle of dracula here madam mina s hypnotic power will surely help and we shall find our way all dark and unknown otherwise after the first sunrise when we are near that fateful place there is much to be done and other places to be made sanctify so that that nest of vipers be obliterated here jonathan interrupted him hotly do you mean to say professor van helsing that you would bring mina in her sad case and tainted as she is with that devil s illness right into the jaws of his death trap not for the world not for heaven or hell he became almost speechless for a minute and then went on do you know what the place is have you seen that awful den of hellish infamy with the very moonlight alive with grisly shapes and every speck of dust that whirls in the wind a devouring monster in embryo have you felt the vampire s lips upon your throat here he turned to me and as his eyes lit on my forehead he threw up his arms with a cry oh my god what have we done to have this terror upon us and he sank down on the sofa in a collapse of misery the professor s voice as he spoke in clear sweet tones which seemed to vibrate in the air calmed us all oh my friend it is because i would save madam mina from that awful place that i would go god forbid that i should take her into that place there is work wild work to be done there that her eyes may not see we men here all save jonathan have seen with their own eyes what is to be done before that place can be purify remember that we are in terrible straits if the count escape us this time and he is strong and subtle and cunning he may choose to sleep him for a century and then in time our dear one he took my hand would come to him to keep him company and would be as those others that you jonathan saw you have told us of their gloating lips you heard their ribald laugh as they clutched the moving bag that the count threw to them you shudder and well may it be forgive me that i make you so much pain but it is necessary my friend is it not a dire need for the which i am giving possibly my life if it were that any one went into that place to stay it is i who would have to go to keep them company do as you will said jonathan with a sob that shook him all over we are in the hands of god later oh it did me good to see the way that these brave men worked how can women help loving men when they are so earnest and so true and so brave and too it made me think of the wonderful power of money what can it not do when it is properly applied and what might it do when basely used i felt so thankful that lord godalming is rich and that both he and mr morris who also has plenty of money are willing to spend it so freely for if they did not our little expedition could not start either so promptly or so well equipped as it will within another hour it is not three hours since it was arranged what part each of us was to do and now lord godalming and jonathan have a lovely steam launch with steam up ready to start at a moment s notice dr seward and mr morris have half a dozen good horses well appointed we have all the maps and appliances of various kinds that can be had professor van helsing and i are to leave by the train to night for veresti where we are to get a carriage to drive to the borgo pass we are bringing a good deal of ready money as we are to buy a carriage and horses we shall drive ourselves for we have no one whom we can trust in the matter the professor knows something of a great many languages so we shall get on all right we have all got arms even for me a large bore revolver jonathan would not be happy unless i was armed like the rest alas i cannot carry one arm that the rest do the scar on my forehead forbids that dear dr van helsing comforts me by telling me that i am fully armed as there may be wolves the weather is getting colder every hour and there are snow flurries which come and go as warnings later it took all my courage to say good bye to my darling we may never meet again courage mina the professor is looking at you keenly his look is a warning there must be no tears now unless it may be that god will let them fall in gladness jonathan harker s journal october night i am writing this in the light from the furnace door of the steam launch lord godalming is firing up he is an experienced hand at the work as he has had for years a launch of his own on the thames and another on the norfolk broads regarding our plans we finally decided that mina s guess was correct and that if any waterway was chosen for the count s escape back to his castle the sereth and then the bistritza at its junction would be the one we took it that somewhere about the th degree north latitude would be the place chosen for the crossing the country between the river and the carpathians we have no fear in running at good speed up the river at night there is plenty of water and the banks are wide enough apart to make steaming even in the dark easy enough lord godalming tells me to sleep for a while as it is enough for the present for one to be on watch but i cannot sleep how can i with the terrible danger hanging over my darling and her going out into that awful place my only comfort is that we are in the hands of god only for that faith it would be easier to die than to live and so be quit of all the trouble mr morris and dr seward were off on their long ride before we started they are to keep up the right bank far enough off to get on higher lands where they can see a good stretch of river and avoid the following of its curves they have for the first stages two men to ride and lead their spare horses four in all so as not to excite curiosity when they dismiss the men which shall be shortly they shall themselves look after the horses it may be necessary for us to join forces if so they can mount our whole party one of the saddles has a movable horn and can be easily adapted for mina if required it is a wild adventure we are on here as we are rushing along through the darkness with the cold from the river seeming to rise up and strike us with all the mysterious voices of the night around us it all comes home we seem to be drifting into unknown places and unknown ways into a whole world of dark and dreadful things godalming is shutting the furnace door october still hurrying along the day has come and godalming is sleeping i am on watch the morning is bitterly cold the furnace heat is grateful though we have heavy fur coats as yet we have passed only a few open boats but none of them had on board any box or package of anything like the size of the one we seek the men were scared every time we turned our electric lamp on them and fell on their knees and prayed november evening no news all day we have found nothing of the kind we seek we have now passed into the bistritza and if we are wrong in our surmise our chance is gone we have over hauled every boat big and little early this morning one crew took us for a government boat and treated us accordingly we saw in this a way of smoothing matters so at fundu where the bistritza runs into the sereth we got a roumanian flag which we now fly conspicuously with every boat which we have over hauled since then this trick has succeeded we have had every deference shown to us and not once any objection to whatever we chose to ask or do some of the slovaks tell us that a big boat passed them going at more than usual speed as she had a double crew on board this was before they came to fundu so they could not tell us whether the boat turned into the bistritza or continued on up the sereth at fundu we could not hear of any such boat so she must have passed there in the night i am feeling very sleepy the cold is perhaps beginning to tell upon me and nature must have rest some time godalming insists that he shall keep the first watch god bless him for all his goodness to poor dear mina and me november morning it is broad daylight that good fellow would not wake me he says it would have been a sin to for i slept peacefully and was forgetting my trouble it seems brutally selfish to me to have slept so long and let him watch all night but he was quite right i am a new man this morning and as i sit here and watch him sleeping i can do all that is necessary both as to minding the engine steering and keeping watch i can feel that my strength and energy are coming back to me i wonder where mina is now and van helsing they should have got to veresti about noon on wednesday it would take them some time to get the carriage and horses so if they had started and travelled hard they would be about now at the borgo pass god guide and help them i am afraid to think what may happen if we could only go faster but we cannot the engines are throbbing and doing their utmost i wonder how dr seward and mr morris are getting on there seem to be endless streams running down the mountains into this river but as none of them are very large at present at all events though they are terrible doubtless in winter and when the snow melts the horsemen may not have met much obstruction i hope that before we get to strasba we may see them for if by that time we have not overtaken the count it may be necessary to take counsel together what to do next dr seward s diary november three days on the road no news and no time to write it if there had been for every moment is precious we have had only the rest needful for the horses but we are both bearing it wonderfully those adventurous days of ours are turning up useful we must push on we shall never feel happy till we get the launch in sight again november we heard at fundu that the launch had gone up the bistritza i wish it wasn t so cold there are signs of snow coming and if it falls heavy it will stop us in such case we must get a sledge and go on russian fashion november to day we heard of the launch having been detained by an accident when trying to force a way up the rapids the slovak boats get up all right by aid of a rope and steering with knowledge some went up only a few hours before godalming is an amateur fitter himself and evidently it was he who put the launch in trim again finally they got up the rapids all right with local help and are off on the chase afresh i fear that the boat is not any better for the accident the peasantry tell us that after she got upon smooth water again she kept stopping every now and again so long as she was in sight we must push on harder than ever our help may be wanted soon mina harker s journal october arrived at veresti at noon the professor tells me that this morning at dawn he could hardly hypnotise me at all and that all i could say was dark and quiet he is off now buying a carriage and horses he says that he will later on try to buy additional horses so that we may be able to change them on the way we have something more than miles before us the country is lovely and most interesting if only we were under different conditions how delightful it would be to see it all if jonathan and i were driving through it alone what a pleasure it would be to stop and see people and learn something of their life and to fill our minds and memories with all the colour and picturesqueness of the whole wild beautiful country and the quaint people but alas later dr van helsing has returned he has got the carriage and horses we are to have some dinner and to start in an hour the landlady is putting us up a huge basket of provisions it seems enough for a company of soldiers the professor encourages her and whispers to me that it may be a week before we can get any good food again he has been shopping too and has sent home such a wonderful lot of fur coats and wraps and all sorts of warm things there will not be any chance of our being cold we shall soon be off i am afraid to think what may happen to us we are truly in the hands of god he alone knows what may be and i pray him with all the strength of my sad and humble soul that he will watch over my beloved husband that whatever may happen jonathan may know that i loved him and honoured him more than i can say and that my latest and truest thought will be always for him chapter xxvii mina harker s journal november all day long we have travelled and at a good speed the horses seem to know that they are being kindly treated for they go willingly their full stage at best speed we have now had so many changes and find the same thing so constantly that we are encouraged to think that the journey will be an easy one dr van helsing is laconic he tells the farmers that he is hurrying to bistritz and pays them well to make the exchange of horses we get hot soup or coffee or tea and off we go it is a lovely country full of beauties of all imaginable kinds and the people are brave and strong and simple and seem full of nice qualities they are very very superstitious in the first house where we stopped when the woman who served us saw the scar on my forehead she crossed herself and put out two fingers towards me to keep off the evil eye i believe they went to the trouble of putting an extra amount of garlic into our food and i can t abide garlic ever since then i have taken care not to take off my hat or veil and so have escaped their suspicions we are travelling fast and as we have no driver with us to carry tales we go ahead of scandal but i daresay that fear of the evil eye will follow hard behind us all the way the professor seems tireless all day he would not take any rest though he made me sleep for a long spell at sunset time he hypnotised me and he says that i answered as usual darkness lapping water and creaking wood so our enemy is still on the river i am afraid to think of jonathan but somehow i have now no fear for him or for myself i write this whilst we wait in a farmhouse for the horses to be got ready dr van helsing is sleeping poor dear he looks very tired and old and grey but his mouth is set as firmly as a conqueror s even in his sleep he is instinct with resolution when we have well started i must make him rest whilst i drive i shall tell him that we have days before us and we must not break down when most of all his strength will be needed all is ready we are off shortly november morning i was successful and we took turns driving all night now the day is on us bright though cold there is a strange heaviness in the air i say heaviness for want of a better word i mean that it oppresses us both it is very cold and only our warm furs keep us comfortable at dawn van helsing hypnotised me he says i answered darkness creaking wood and roaring water so the river is changing as they ascend i do hope that my darling will not run any chance of danger more than need be but we are in god s hands november night all day long driving the country gets wilder as we go and the great spurs of the carpathians which at veresti seemed so far from us and so low on the horizon now seem to gather round us and tower in front we both seem in good spirits i think we make an effort each to cheer the other in the doing so we cheer ourselves dr van helsing says that by morning we shall reach the borgo pass the houses are very few here now and the professor says that the last horse we got will have to go on with us as we may not be able to change he got two in addition to the two we changed so that now we have a rude four in hand the dear horses are patient and good and they give us no trouble we are not worried with other travellers and so even i can drive we shall get to the pass in daylight we do not want to arrive before so we take it easy and have each a long rest in turn oh what will to morrow bring to us we go to seek the place where my poor darling suffered so much god grant that we may be guided aright and that he will deign to watch over my husband and those dear to us both and who are in such deadly peril as for me i am not worthy in his sight alas i am unclean to his eyes and shall be until he may deign to let me stand forth in his sight as one of those who have not incurred his wrath memorandum by abraham van helsing november this to my old and true friend john seward m d of purfleet london in case i may not see him it may explain it is morning and i write by a fire which all the night i have kept alive madam mina aiding me it is cold cold so cold that the grey heavy sky is full of snow which when it falls will settle for all winter as the ground is hardening to receive it it seems to have affected madam mina she has been so heavy of head all day that she was not like herself she sleeps and sleeps and sleeps she who is usual so alert have done literally nothing all the day she even have lost her appetite she make no entry into her little diary she who write so faithful at every pause something whisper to me that all is not well however to night she is more vif her long sleep all day have refresh and restore her for now she is all sweet and bright as ever at sunset i try to hypnotise her but alas with no effect the power has grown less and less with each day and to night it fail me altogether well god s will be done whatever it may be and whithersoever it may lead now to the historical for as madam mina write not in her stenography i must in my cumbrous old fashion that so each day of us may not go unrecorded we got to the borgo pass just after sunrise yesterday morning when i saw the signs of the dawn i got ready for the hypnotism we stopped our carriage and got down so that there might be no disturbance i made a couch with furs and madam mina lying down yield herself as usual but more slow and more short time than ever to the hypnotic sleep as before came the answer darkness and the swirling of water then she woke bright and radiant and we go on our way and soon reach the pass at this time and place she become all on fire with zeal some new guiding power be in her manifested for she point to a road and say this is the way how know you it i ask of course i know it she answer and with a pause add have not my jonathan travelled it and wrote of his travel at first i think somewhat strange but soon i see that there be only one such by road it is used but little and very different from the coach road from the bukovina to bistritz which is more wide and hard and more of use so we came down this road when we meet other ways not always were we sure that they were roads at all for they be neglect and light snow have fallen the horses know and they only i give rein to them and they go on so patient by and by we find all the things which jonathan have note in that wonderful diary of him then we go on for long long hours and hours at the first i tell madam mina to sleep she try and she succeed she sleep all the time till at the last i feel myself to suspicious grow and attempt to wake her but she sleep on and i may not wake her though i try i do not wish to try too hard lest i harm her for i know that she have suffer much and sleep at times be all in all to her i think i drowse myself for all of sudden i feel guilt as though i have done something i find myself bolt up with the reins in my hand and the good horses go along jog jog just as ever i look down and find madam mina still sleep it is now not far off sunset time and over the snow the light of the sun flow in big yellow flood so that we throw great long shadow on where the mountain rise so steep for we are going up and up and all is oh so wild and rocky as though it were the end of the world then i arouse madam mina this time she wake with not much trouble and then i try to put her to hypnotic sleep but she sleep not being as though i were not still i try and try till all at once i find her and myself in dark so i look round and find that the sun have gone down madam mina laugh and i turn and look at her she is now quite awake and look so well as i never saw her since that night at carfax when we first enter the count s house i am amaze and not at ease then but she is so bright and tender and thoughtful for me that i forget all fear i light a fire for we have brought supply of wood with us and she prepare food while i undo the horses and set them tethered in shelter to feed then when i return to the fire she have my supper ready i go to help her but she smile and tell me that she have eat already that she was so hungry that she would not wait i like it not and i have grave doubts but i fear to affright her and so i am silent of it she help me and i eat alone and then we wrap in fur and lie beside the fire and i tell her to sleep while i watch but presently i forget all of watching and when i sudden remember that i watch i find her lying quiet but awake and looking at me with so bright eyes once twice more the same occur and i get much sleep till before morning when i wake i try to hypnotise her but alas though she shut her eyes obedient she may not sleep the sun rise up and up and up and then sleep come to her too late but so heavy that she will not wake i have to lift her up and place her sleeping in the carriage when i have harnessed the horses and made all ready madam still sleep and she look in her sleep more healthy and more redder than before and i like it not and i am afraid afraid afraid i am afraid of all things even to think but i must go on my way the stake we play for is life and death or more than these and we must not flinch november morning let me be accurate in everything for though you and i have seen some strange things together you may at the first think that i van helsing am mad that the many horrors and the so long strain on nerves has at the last turn my brain all yesterday we travel ever getting closer to the mountains and moving into a more and more wild and desert land there are great frowning precipices and much falling water and nature seem to have held sometime her carnival madam mina still sleep and sleep and though i did have hunger and appeased it i could not waken her even for food i began to fear that the fatal spell of the place was upon her tainted as she is with that vampire baptism well said i to myself if it be that she sleep all the day it shall also be that i do not sleep at night as we travel on the rough road for a road of an ancient and imperfect kind there was i held down my head and slept again i waked with a sense of guilt and of time passed and found madam mina still sleeping and the sun low down but all was indeed changed the frowning mountains seemed further away and we were near the top of a steep rising hill on summit of which was such a castle as jonathan tell of in his diary at once i exulted and feared for now for good or ill the end was near i woke madam mina and again tried to hypnotise her but alas unavailing till too late then ere the great dark came upon us for even after down sun the heavens reflected the gone sun on the snow and all was for a time in a great twilight i took out the horses and fed them in what shelter i could then i make a fire and near it i make madam mina now awake and more charming than ever sit comfortable amid her rugs i got ready food but she would not eat simply saying that she had not hunger i did not press her knowing her unavailingness but i myself eat for i must needs now be strong for all then with the fear on me of what might be i drew a ring so big for her comfort round where madam mina sat and over the ring i passed some of the wafer and i broke it fine so that all was well guarded she sat still all the time so still as one dead and she grew whiter and ever whiter till the snow was not more pale and no word she said but when i drew near she clung to me and i could know that the poor soul shook her from head to feet with a tremor that was pain to feel i said to her presently when she had grown more quiet will you not come over to the fire for i wished to make a test of what she could she rose obedient but when she have made a step she stopped and stood as one stricken why not go on i asked she shook her head and coming back sat down in her place then looking at me with open eyes as of one waked from sleep she said simply i cannot and remained silent i rejoiced for i knew that what she could not none of those that we dreaded could though there might be danger to her body yet her soul was safe presently the horses began to scream and tore at their tethers till i came to them and quieted them when they did feel my hands on them they whinnied low as in joy and licked at my hands and were quiet for a time many times through the night did i come to them till it arrive to the cold hour when all nature is at lowest and every time my coming was with quiet of them in the cold hour the fire began to die and i was about stepping forth to replenish it for now the snow came in flying sweeps and with it a chill mist even in the dark there was a light of some kind as there ever is over snow and it seemed as though the snow flurries and the wreaths of mist took shape as of women with trailing garments all was in dead grim silence only that the horses whinnied and cowered as if in terror of the worst i began to fear horrible fears but then came to me the sense of safety in that ring wherein i stood i began too to think that my imaginings were of the night and the gloom and the unrest that i have gone through and all the terrible anxiety it was as though my memories of all jonathan s horrid experience were befooling me for the snow flakes and the mist began to wheel and circle round till i could get as though a shadowy glimpse of those women that would have kissed him and then the horses cowered lower and lower and moaned in terror as men do in pain even the madness of fright was not to them so that they could break away i feared for my dear madam mina when these weird figures drew near and circled round i looked at her but she sat calm and smiled at me when i would have stepped to the fire to replenish it she caught me and held me back and whispered like a voice that one hears in a dream so low it was no no do not go without here you are safe i turned to her and looking in her eyes said but you it is for you that i fear whereat she laughed a laugh low and unreal and said fear for me why fear for me none safer in all the world from them than i am and as i wondered at the meaning of her words a puff of wind made the flame leap up and i see the red scar on her forehead then alas i knew did i not i would soon have learned for the wheeling figures of mist and snow came closer but keeping ever without the holy circle then they began to materialise till if god have not take away my reason for i saw it through my eyes there were before me in actual flesh the same three women that jonathan saw in the room when they would have kissed his throat i knew the swaying round forms the bright hard eyes the white teeth the ruddy colour the voluptuous lips they smiled ever at poor dear madam mina and as their laugh came through the silence of the night they twined their arms and pointed to her and said in those so sweet tingling tones that jonathan said were of the intolerable sweetness of the water glasses come sister come to us come come in fear i turned to my poor madam mina and my heart with gladness leapt like flame for oh the terror in her sweet eyes the repulsion the horror told a story to my heart that was all of hope god be thanked she was not yet of them i seized some of the firewood which was by me and holding out some of the wafer advanced on them towards the fire they drew back before me and laughed their low horrid laugh i fed the fire and feared them not for i knew that we were safe within our protections they could not approach me whilst so armed nor madam mina whilst she remained within the ring which she could not leave no more than they could enter the horses had ceased to moan and lay still on the ground the snow fell on them softly and they grew whiter i knew that there was for the poor beasts no more of terror and so we remained till the red of the dawn to fall through the snow gloom i was desolate and afraid and full of woe and terror but when that beautiful sun began to climb the horizon life was to me again at the first coming of the dawn the horrid figures melted in the whirling mist and snow the wreaths of transparent gloom moved away towards the castle and were lost instinctively with the dawn coming i turned to madam mina intending to hypnotise her but she lay in a deep and sudden sleep from which i could not wake her i tried to hypnotise through her sleep but she made no response none at all and the day broke i fear yet to stir i have made my fire and have seen the horses they are all dead to day i have much to do here and i keep waiting till the sun is up high for there may be places where i must go where that sunlight though snow and mist obscure it will be to me a safety i will strengthen me with breakfast and then i will to my terrible work madam mina still sleeps and god be thanked she is calm in her sleep jonathan harker s journal november evening the accident to the launch has been a terrible thing for us only for it we should have overtaken the boat long ago and by now my dear mina would have been free i fear to think of her off on the wolds near that horrid place we have got horses and we follow on the track i note this whilst godalming is getting ready we have our arms the szgany must look out if they mean fight oh if only morris and seward were with us we must only hope if i write no more good bye mina god bless and keep you dr seward s diary november with the dawn we saw the body of szgany before us dashing away from the river with their leiter wagon they surrounded it in a cluster and hurried along as though beset the snow is falling lightly and there is a strange excitement in the air it may be our own feelings but the depression is strange far off i hear the howling of wolves the snow brings them down from the mountains and there are dangers to all of us and from all sides the horses are nearly ready and we are soon off we ride to death of some one god alone knows who or where or what or when or how it may be dr van helsing s memorandum november afternoon i am at least sane thank god for that mercy at all events though the proving it has been dreadful when i left madam mina sleeping within the holy circle i took my way to the castle the blacksmith hammer which i took in the carriage from veresti was useful though the doors were all open i broke them off the rusty hinges lest some ill intent or ill chance should close them so that being entered i might not get out jonathan s bitter experience served me here by memory of his diary i found my way to the old chapel for i knew that here my work lay the air was oppressive it seemed as if there was some sulphurous fume which at times made me dizzy either there was a roaring in my ears or i heard afar off the howl of wolves then i bethought me of my dear madam mina and i was in terrible plight the dilemma had me between his horns her i had not dare to take into this place but left safe from the vampire in that holy circle and yet even there would be the wolf i resolve me that my work lay here and that as to the wolves we must submit if it were god s will at any rate it was only death and freedom beyond so did i choose for her had it but been for myself the choice had been easy the maw of the wolf were better to rest in than the grave of the vampire so i make my choice to go on with my work i knew that there were at least three graves to find graves that are inhabit so i search and search and i find one of them she lay in her vampire sleep so full of life and voluptuous beauty that i shudder as though i have come to do murder ah i doubt not that in old time when such things were many a man who set forth to do such a task as mine found at the last his heart fail him and then his nerve so he delay and delay and delay till the mere beauty and the fascination of the wanton un dead have hypnotise him and he remain on and on till sunset come and the vampire sleep be over then the beautiful eyes of the fair woman open and look love and the voluptuous mouth present to a kiss and man is weak and there remain one more victim in the vampire fold one more to swell the grim and grisly ranks of the un dead there is some fascination surely when i am moved by the mere presence of such an one even lying as she lay in a tomb fretted with age and heavy with the dust of centuries though there be that horrid odour such as the lairs of the count have had yes i was moved i van helsing with all my purpose and with my motive for hate i was moved to a yearning for delay which seemed to paralyse my faculties and to clog my very soul it may have been that the need of natural sleep and the strange oppression of the air were beginning to overcome me certain it was that i was lapsing into sleep the open eyed sleep of one who yields to a sweet fascination when there came through the snow stilled air a long low wail so full of woe and pity that it woke me like the sound of a clarion for it was the voice of my dear madam mina that i heard then i braced myself again to my horrid task and found by wrenching away tomb tops one other of the sisters the other dark one i dared not pause to look on her as i had on her sister lest once more i should begin to be enthrall but i go on searching until presently i find in a high great tomb as if made to one much beloved that other fair sister which like jonathan i had seen to gather herself out of the atoms of the mist she was so fair to look on so radiantly beautiful so exquisitely voluptuous that the very instinct of man in me which calls some of my sex to love and to protect one of hers made my head whirl with new emotion but god be thanked that soul wail of my dear madam mina had not died out of my ears and before the spell could be wrought further upon me i had nerved myself to my wild work by this time i had searched all the tombs in the chapel so far as i could tell and as there had been only three of these un dead phantoms around us in the night i took it that there were no more of active un dead existent there was one great tomb more lordly than all the rest huge it was and nobly proportioned on it was but one word dracula this then was the un dead home of the king vampire to whom so many more were due its emptiness spoke eloquent to make certain what i knew before i began to restore these women to their dead selves through my awful work i laid in dracula s tomb some of the wafer and so banished him from it un dead for ever then began my terrible task and i dreaded it had it been but one it had been easy comparative but three to begin twice more after i had been through a deed of horror for if it was terrible with the sweet miss lucy what would it not be with these strange ones who had survived through centuries and who had been strengthened by the passing of the years who would if they could have fought for their foul lives oh my friend john but it was butcher work had i not been nerved by thoughts of other dead and of the living over whom hung such a pall of fear i could not have gone on i tremble and tremble even yet though till all was over god be thanked my nerve did stand had i not seen the repose in the first place and the gladness that stole over it just ere the final dissolution came as realisation that the soul had been won i could not have gone further with my butchery i could not have endured the horrid screeching as the stake drove home the plunging of writhing form and lips of bloody foam i should have fled in terror and left my work undone but it is over and the poor souls i can pity them now and weep as i think of them placid each in her full sleep of death for a short moment ere fading for friend john hardly had my knife severed the head of each before the whole body began to melt away and crumble in to its native dust as though the death that should have come centuries agone had at last assert himself and say at once and loud i am here before i left the castle i so fixed its entrances that never more can the count enter there un dead when i stepped into the circle where madam mina slept she woke from her sleep and seeing me cried out in pain that i had endured too much come she said come away from this awful place let us go to meet my husband who is i know coming towards us she was looking thin and pale and weak but her eyes were pure and glowed with fervour i was glad to see her paleness and her illness for my mind was full of the fresh horror of that ruddy vampire sleep and so with trust and hope and yet full of fear we go eastward to meet our friends and him whom madam mina tell me that she know are coming to meet us mina harker s journal november it was late in the afternoon when the professor and i took our way towards the east whence i knew jonathan was coming we did not go fast though the way was steeply downhill for we had to take heavy rugs and wraps with us we dared not face the possibility of being left without warmth in the cold and the snow we had to take some of our provisions too for we were in a perfect desolation and so far as we could see through the snowfall there was not even the sign of habitation when we had gone about a mile i was tired with the heavy walking and sat down to rest then we looked back and saw where the clear line of dracula s castle cut the sky for we were so deep under the hill whereon it was set that the angle of perspective of the carpathian mountains was far below it we saw it in all its grandeur perched a thousand feet on the summit of a sheer precipice and with seemingly a great gap between it and the steep of the adjacent mountain on any side there was something wild and uncanny about the place we could hear the distant howling of wolves they were far off but the sound even though coming muffled through the deadening snowfall was full of terror i knew from the way dr van helsing was searching about that he was trying to seek some strategic point where we would be less exposed in case of attack the rough roadway still led downwards we could trace it through the drifted snow in a little while the professor signalled to me so i got up and joined him he had found a wonderful spot a sort of natural hollow in a rock with an entrance like a doorway between two boulders he took me by the hand and drew me in see he said here you will be in shelter and if the wolves do come i can meet them one by one he brought in our furs and made a snug nest for me and got out some provisions and forced them upon me but i could not eat to even try to do so was repulsive to me and much as i would have liked to please him i could not bring myself to the attempt he looked very sad but did not reproach me taking his field glasses from the case he stood on the top of the rock and began to search the horizon suddenly he called out look madam mina look look i sprang up and stood beside him on the rock he handed me his glasses and pointed the snow was now falling more heavily and swirled about fiercely for a high wind was beginning to blow however there were times when there were pauses between the snow flurries and i could see a long way round from the height where we were it was possible to see a great distance and far off beyond the white waste of snow i could see the river lying like a black ribbon in kinks and curls as it wound its way straight in front of us and not far off in fact so near that i wondered we had not noticed before came a group of mounted men hurrying along in the midst of them was a cart a long leiter wagon which swept from side to side like a dog s tail wagging with each stern inequality of the road outlined against the snow as they were i could see from the men s clothes that they were peasants or gypsies of some kind on the cart was a great square chest my heart leaped as i saw it for i felt that the end was coming the evening was now drawing close and well i knew that at sunset the thing which was till then imprisoned there would take new freedom and could in any of many forms elude all pursuit in fear i turned to the professor to my consternation however he was not there an instant later i saw him below me round the rock he had drawn a circle such as we had found shelter in last night when he had completed it he stood beside me again saying at least you shall be safe here from him he took the glasses from me and at the next lull of the snow swept the whole space below us see he said they come quickly they are flogging the horses and galloping as hard as they can he paused and went on in a hollow voice they are racing for the sunset we may be too late god s will be done down came another blinding rush of driving snow and the whole landscape was blotted out it soon passed however and once more his glasses were fixed on the plain then came a sudden cry look look look see two horsemen follow fast coming up from the south it must be quincey and john take the glass look before the snow blots it all out i took it and looked the two men might be dr seward and mr morris i knew at all events that neither of them was jonathan at the same time i knew that jonathan was not far off looking around i saw on the north side of the coming party two other men riding at break neck speed one of them i knew was jonathan and the other i took of course to be lord godalming they too were pursuing the party with the cart when i told the professor he shouted in glee like a schoolboy and after looking intently till a snow fall made sight impossible he laid his winchester rifle ready for use against the boulder at the opening of our shelter they are all converging he said when the time comes we shall have gypsies on all sides i got out my revolver ready to hand for whilst we were speaking the howling of wolves came louder and closer when the snow storm abated a moment we looked again it was strange to see the snow falling in such heavy flakes close to us and beyond the sun shining more and more brightly as it sank down towards the far mountain tops sweeping the glass all around us i could see here and there dots moving singly and in twos and threes and larger numbers the wolves were gathering for their prey every instant seemed an age whilst we waited the wind came now in fierce bursts and the snow was driven with fury as it swept upon us in circling eddies at times we could not see an arm s length before us but at others as the hollow sounding wind swept by us it seemed to clear the air space around us so that we could see afar off we had of late been so accustomed to watch for sunrise and sunset that we knew with fair accuracy when it would be and we knew that before long the sun would set it was hard to believe that by our watches it was less than an hour that we waited in that rocky shelter before the various bodies began to converge close upon us the wind came now with fiercer and more bitter sweeps and more steadily from the north it seemingly had driven the snow clouds from us for with only occasional bursts the snow fell we could distinguish clearly the individuals of each party the pursued and the pursuers strangely enough those pursued did not seem to realise or at least to care that they were pursued they seemed however to hasten with redoubled speed as the sun dropped lower and lower on the mountain tops closer and closer they drew the professor and i crouched down behind our rock and held our weapons ready i could see that he was determined that they should not pass one and all were quite unaware of our presence all at once two voices shouted out to halt one was my jonathan s raised in a high key of passion the other mr morris strong resolute tone of quiet command the gypsies may not have known the language but there was no mistaking the tone in whatever tongue the words were spoken instinctively they reined in and at the instant lord godalming and jonathan dashed up at one side and dr seward and mr morris on the other the leader of the gypsies a splendid looking fellow who sat his horse like a centaur waved them back and in a fierce voice gave to his companions some word to proceed they lashed the horses which sprang forward but the four men raised their winchester rifles and in an unmistakable way commanded them to stop at the same moment dr van helsing and i rose behind the rock and pointed our weapons at them seeing that they were surrounded the men tightened their reins and drew up the leader turned to them and gave a word at which every man of the gypsy party drew what weapon he carried knife or pistol and held himself in readiness to attack issue was joined in an instant the leader with a quick movement of his rein threw his horse out in front and pointing first to the sun now close down on the hill tops and then to the castle said something which i did not understand for answer all four men of our party threw themselves from their horses and dashed towards the cart i should have felt terrible fear at seeing jonathan in such danger but that the ardour of battle must have been upon me as well as the rest of them i felt no fear but only a wild surging desire to do something seeing the quick movement of our parties the leader of the gypsies gave a command his men instantly formed round the cart in a sort of undisciplined endeavour each one shouldering and pushing the other in his eagerness to carry out the order in the midst of this i could see that jonathan on one side of the ring of men and quincey on the other were forcing a way to the cart it was evident that they were bent on finishing their task before the sun should set nothing seemed to stop or even to hinder them neither the levelled weapons nor the flashing knives of the gypsies in front nor the howling of the wolves behind appeared to even attract their attention jonathan s impetuosity and the manifest singleness of his purpose seemed to overawe those in front of him instinctively they cowered aside and let him pass in an instant he had jumped upon the cart and with a strength which seemed incredible raised the great box and flung it over the wheel to the ground in the meantime mr morris had had to use force to pass through his side of the ring of szgany all the time i had been breathlessly watching jonathan i had with the tail of my eye seen him pressing desperately forward and had seen the knives of the gypsies flash as he won a way through them and they cut at him he had parried with his great bowie knife and at first i thought that he too had come through in safety but as he sprang beside jonathan who had by now jumped from the cart i could see that with his left hand he was clutching at his side and that the blood was spurting through his fingers he did not delay notwithstanding this for as jonathan with desperate energy attacked one end of the chest attempting to prize off the lid with his great kukri knife he attacked the other frantically with his bowie under the efforts of both men the lid began to yield the nails drew with a quick screeching sound and the top of the box was thrown back by this time the gypsies seeing themselves covered by the winchesters and at the mercy of lord godalming and dr seward had given in and made no resistance the sun was almost down on the mountain tops and the shadows of the whole group fell long upon the snow i saw the count lying within the box upon the earth some of which the rude falling from the cart had scattered over him he was deathly pale just like a waxen image and the red eyes glared with the horrible vindictive look which i knew too well as i looked the eyes saw the sinking sun and the look of hate in them turned to triumph but on the instant came the sweep and flash of jonathan s great knife i shrieked as i saw it shear through the throat whilst at the same moment mr morris s bowie knife plunged into the heart it was like a miracle but before our very eyes and almost in the drawing of a breath the whole body crumbled into dust and passed from our sight i shall be glad as long as i live that even in that moment of final dissolution there was in the face a look of peace such as i never could have imagined might have rested there the castle of dracula now stood out against the red sky and every stone of its broken battlements was articulated against the light of the setting sun the gypsies taking us as in some way the cause of the extraordinary disappearance of the dead man turned without a word and rode away as if for their lives those who were unmounted jumped upon the leiter wagon and shouted to the horsemen not to desert them the wolves which had withdrawn to a safe distance followed in their wake leaving us alone mr morris who had sunk to the ground leaned on his elbow holding his hand pressed to his side the blood still gushed through his fingers i flew to him for the holy circle did not now keep me back so did the two doctors jonathan knelt behind him and the wounded man laid back his head on his shoulder with a sigh he took with a feeble effort my hand in that of his own which was unstained he must have seen the anguish of my heart in my face for he smiled at me and said i am only too happy to have been of any service oh god he cried suddenly struggling up to a sitting posture and pointing to me it was worth for this to die look look the sun was now right down upon the mountain top and the red gleams fell upon my face so that it was bathed in rosy light with one impulse the men sank on their knees and a deep and earnest amen broke from all as their eyes followed the pointing of his finger the dying man spoke now god be thanked that all has not been in vain see the snow is not more stainless than her forehead the curse has passed away and to our bitter grief with a smile and in silence he died a gallant gentleman note seven years ago we all went through the flames and the happiness of some of us since then is we think well worth the pain we endured it is an added joy to mina and to me that our boy s birthday is the same day as that on which quincey morris died his mother holds i know the secret belief that some of our brave friend s spirit has passed into him his bundle of names links all our little band of men together but we call him quincey in the summer of this year we made a journey to transylvania and went over the old ground which was and is to us so full of vivid and terrible memories it was almost impossible to believe that the things which we had seen with our own eyes and heard with our own ears were living truths every trace of all that had been was blotted out the castle stood as before reared high above a waste of desolation when we got home we were talking of the old time which we could all look back on without despair for godalming and seward are both happily married i took the papers from the safe where they had been ever since our return so long ago we were struck with the fact that in all the mass of material of which the record is composed there is hardly one authentic document nothing but a mass of typewriting except the later note books of mina and seward and myself and van helsing s memorandum we could hardly ask any one even did we wish to to accept these as proofs of so wild a story van helsing summed it all up as he said with our boy on his knee we want no proofs we ask none to believe us this boy will some day know what a brave and gallant woman his mother is already he knows her sweetness and loving care later on he will understand how some men so loved her that they did dare much for her sake jonathan harker the end there s more to follow more stories of the sort you like more probably by the author of this one more
